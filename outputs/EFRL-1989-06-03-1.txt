**spk_0:** [00:02.17 - 00:11.05] Today Americans get their first taste of what I'm certain will be an exciting and most helpful call-in program on parents' rights in education.

**spk_1:** [00:25.58 - 00:31.90] Perspective.The USA Radio Network and Eagle-Forum present Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_2:** [00:32.69 - 00:34.06] This is Phyllis-Schlafly

**spk_1:** [00:34.06 - 01:20.87] live on parents' rights in education,and this is Bruce Hayes.Today talk radio has many successful counseling programs,but until now.Has addressed one of the most important subjects of all.What our children are taught in public schools and what parents can do to protect their children's faith,values and morals.Well,today we present the first such program.America's most admired and respected women.Her radio commentary is heard on 250 radio stations,and her biweekly column is in 200 publications.For many years she's informed us on many issues,but during this program she plans to focus her pro-family perspective toward education.Your rights as a parent.Here now is Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [01:21.46 - 02:38.97] Hello everybody and welcome to this premiere.Of Radio Live on parents' rights in education at our Eagle-Forum Parents Advisory Center,we get calls from parents all the time who are complaining about courses,curriculum,materials,or films that may be offensive to their faith and morals,and you.You know,funny thing,most of these parents are told you are the only one who ever complained.We hope by this program you will be able to find out that there are other parents who have experienced the same type of courses,and you'll learn what they are doing about it.Today we're going to talk about a very interesting witchcraft,Satanism,and the occult.Now we're not talking about just some.Cults,uh,who may be,uh,down the block or some criminal activity.We're talking particularly about how this is encountered in the classrooms.Uh,you would be surprised to know that even though Bible stories and news about Christ,uh,have been censored out of the schools,uh,there often is material about witches and Satan.I think we have a call waiting already,don't we,Bern?

**spk_1:** [02:40.03 - 03:03.16] Don't we pass out the lines to.Via satellites on the USA.Our toll-free number,be sure to jot it down because you'll want to keep it for weeks to come.1-800-736-3202.And this is Sylvia calling over KSIV in St.Louis,incidentally our upling station.Hi there,Sylvia,you're on the air.

**spk_0:** [03:03.54 - 03:07.00] Hello.Hi Sylvia,do you have a comment or a question?

**spk_3:** [03:07.94 - 05:18.69] Uh,I have a comment about a situation that occurred in our family.Uh,this occurred approximately 3 years ago,uh,with my oldest daughter.She was 15 at the time and a junior in high school.Uh,very good student,popular,real pretty,involved in sports.Um,one of the first things that,uh,we saw as a change is that the music that my daughter was listening to all of a sudden just changed.What we heard coming out of the room was some heavy metal music,and before she had always been interested in some of the oldies,the 50s and.During this first week I noticed.A very slight change in her starting to isolate herself from the family.It wasn't anything dramatic.It was just a little,just a slight change.This all occurred in one week.Within the second week.A teacher from her school called and said that she was really concerned.Uh,my daughter had been a good student and for the last two weeks she wasn't handing in any homework.And uh she had fallen asleep in class a couple of times.I asked my daughter about it.She told me that it was because of the basketball tournament that she was involved in,and I accepted that as an excuse at that time.The next day I had her counselor at school,uh,check with all of the teachers for a progress report,and most of their reports came back the same,that in 2 weeks there had been a dramatic change in her activities at school.The 3rd week I walked into my daughter's room and found her.There was a suicide attempt.Uh,we then she ended up in a psychiatric hospital.We were told upon admission that she would probably only be there for 3 weeks.We were just appalled.We had no idea what was going on.Uh,two weeks into her being in the hospital,the psychiatrist told us that he was also really baffled.She seemed to be a very happy,normal child in the hospital.She had everything a normal 15-year-old would want,but there was one thing,and she was really terrified of going back to school,and he didn't know what was going on,but he knew it had to do something with school.Uh,since she thought she was getting out in 3 weeks,it was about 2.5 weeks into her treatment that she told her psychiatrist what was really going on.When they had a meeting at the hospital and told the family,I didn't believe it.

**spk_0:** [05:19.54 - 05:21.40] Well,what was it,the suspenses.

**spk_3:** [05:21.78 - 05:30.43] What he told us is that she was actively being pursued by a satanic cult in her school,that they were trying to recruit her into their coven.

**spk_0:** [05:32.36 - 05:33.73] Um,were these other students in the school,

**spk_3:** [05:34.35 - 05:59.87] as we found out,there were students in the school that were involved in this coven.There were also adults in the community.That were involved in this coven,one of the things that they so-called believe is that if they can get,um,what they consider a good or a pure person involved in their coven,that they receive a lot of power from this,and this is why they were doing,they,they had chose my daughter.She had just been elected to a class officer,and she had gotten a lot of attention in school at that time.

**spk_0:** [06:01.60 - 06:03.51] weren't any personnel involved in

**spk_4:** [06:03.51 - 06:03.81] this,right?No,not that we know of,

**spk_3:** [06:05.74 - 06:45.18] no,not that we know of.Uh,we were,we found out that she had been having night terrors and that was one of the reasons she was sleeping during the day,that she couldn't go to sleep and was afraid to go to sleep at night.We found out that she had been.That if she would say anything to the family about them wanting her to become involved,that they would kill our youngest daughter.And uh they also convinced her through what the psychiatrist told us was a lot of mind control that they were using.Also,she wasn't sleeping,so she was,it was real hard for her.She was confused at this time.They told her that if she didn't follow through that they would have her possessed by demons.And reminded her of the movie The Exorcist and told her that's what would happen with her.

**spk_0:** [06:45.38 - 06:49.80] Well,did you find any connection between any of this and what she was studying in school?

**spk_4:** [06:50.74 - 06:50.87] Uh,

**spk_3:** [06:50.94 - 07:40.92] one of the things that the psychiatrist told us was that he had seen approximately 20 to 30 students over the last year.This is a very large high school from this high school that were involved.And I asked him why,and he,he told me to check out the reading material that was available in the school,that there was too much,pardon me,did you check it out?Yes,I did.I went to the school library and I went through the cardexes and just started looking under S for Satanism and W for witchcraft,and I just started writing down numbers.I stopped at 80 books.Flipping through the cards,I found approximately 200.I then went to the shelves.This is in the high school library.Yes,ma'am.I then went to the shelves,and there were no books on this subject on the shelves,so I asked the librarian if they kept them behind,uh,the library,and she laughed and told me that these books were never on the shelves.They were always checked out,and that they had a high rate of non-return to the library.

**spk_0:** [07:41.12 - 07:42.83] That means the students are keeping the books.

**spk_3:** [07:42.96 - 07:56.60] Yes,well,there was a lot of spells and incantations and things like that described in these books,so they were keeping.However,she did tell me that if I was interested in this subject that I could talk to one of the teachers at school,that they had a course on Satanism and witchcraft in the school.

**spk_4:** [07:56.83 - 07:57.88] Oh,you don't mean it.

**spk_3:** [07:58.12 - 08:04.94] Yes,it's a,it was an elective course.Uh,you received a half a credit for it,and it was a half a semester course.

**spk_4:** [08:05.28 - 08:05.79] Um,

**spk_3:** [08:05.96 - 08:26.13] I said that I,I had never seen a course like this in the class curriculum.She told me the name of the course,the name of this particular course by hearing it,you would not have believed that it had anything to do with Satanism or witchcraft,but that was the subject matter taught.I did talk with his teacher.He told me that he was really concerned that something like this was being taught in the school.

**spk_0:** [08:26.48 - 08:34.54] What was the name of the course?It was cultural hysteria.You never would have guessed that would be about,uh,witchcraft,

**spk_3:** [08:34.64 - 08:48.02] right?He told me,uh,that because he was a Christian,he taught this course.He was afraid it would get into the wrong hands,and very rapidly there would be kids that would be harmed by this course.He said he had no idea who would be teaching this after he left the

**spk_4:** [08:48.02 - 08:48.36] school.

**spk_0:** [08:49.82 - 08:54.01] Oh,did you take this up with the authorities?Are they still teaching the course?As far

**spk_3:** [08:54.01 - 08:56.22] as I know,the course is still being taught in the school,yes.

**spk_0:** [08:57.20 - 09:04.29] And did you say anything to the school about all these,these,uh,heavy numbers of books on witchcraft in the school library?

**spk_4:** [09:04.74 - 09:04.98] Since

**spk_3:** [09:05.33 - 09:38.73] this occurred and I started walking down the school halls and seeing kids that,yes,had a lot of satanic paraphernalia and they were roaming the halls like gangs sometimes,I became extremely involved not only in the schools,with the community and with um law enforcement.That's one of the things that I want to get across to people today.If you don't hear anything else,first of all,if you don't believe this is going on,you're wrong.It is,and please don't wait until something,a crisis has to occur in your family before you want to take a stand against it,because it's not worth the heartache involved.

**spk_0:** [09:39.69 - 09:43.63] Well,I hope you've had a complete recovery on the part of your daughter.

**spk_3:** [09:43.80 - 09:55.85] My daughter is doing fine.I do want people to know one other thing.It does not matter if you believe that these people can do what they say they can do.The important thing is,is that they believe it,and that's what makes them dangerous.

**spk_0:** [09:57.17 - 10:23.15] Oh,thank you,thank you very much,Sylvia,for calling.We appreciate you sharing your story with us,and,uh,I,I'm sorry I have to say that is typical of the type of calls we get at our Eagle-Forum Parents Advisory Center.Um,there are others who have shared your experience.Um,well,I'm glad it had a happy ending,and I'm glad you're alert to what is going on,and thank you for telling your story for others.You're welcome.Thanks for calling.Bye-bye.

**spk_0:** [18:43.32 - 19:02.06] Sharon,thank you for hanging on.You were telling us about a book called Bed Knobs,Broomsticks and Things in the Night.Uh,I,I'm sorry you called that a classic.When I think of classics,I think of Shakespeare and things like that,and I never heard of this.Just tell us briefly what's in it and why you think it's harmful.

**spk_4:** [19:04.41 - 19:50.31] I opened it up and Stories that were supposed to come out of folklore that were.And categories divided up such as ghosts,witches.And in the back of this book,it actually had a On how to summon spirits and how to summon ghosts and witches all under the guise of.Folklore Actually divided up different categories that would constitute the occult.Now they did remove this from the library,but they were very surprised that I had objected because it had been there since about 1953.parent complained apparently so.

**spk_0:** [19:50.48 - 19:55.48] Well,that's probably because most parents didn't know about it.I was really appalled and

**spk_4:** [19:55.48 - 19:58.29] I was told at the time that there were probably a lot of,

**spk_3:** [19:59.15 - 19:59.44] excuse me,

**spk_4:** [19:59.56 - 20:19.91] other books that I would not like in the library,and I might encourage that.Can't clean out everything all at once,but you can handle what affects your child.And all I said was,Well,this is the one that my daughter brought home,and this has upset my family,and I would appreciate it if this book was not here.

**spk_0:** [20:20.33 - 20:21.70] And what grade level was that?That

**spk_4:** [20:22.69 - 21:02.51] that was probably about 3rd grade,but it would have been available for all of elementary school.And it had such gruesome things as cutting a child's head off and putting it in a garden and the child talking from the garden from the dead.And I remember that vividly because it was just so.But I might just add in general that at least from what we're seeing here through this organization,the occult is definitely on the rise,whether it's through Dungeons and Dragons,which does lead a child eventually into witchcraft or Satanism.It definitely has the occult in it,or we wouldn't say that it would be epidemic proportions,

**spk_3:** [21:02.79 - 21:03.87] but we definitely are

**spk_4:** [21:03.87 - 21:04.47] seeing it.

**spk_0:** [36:08.81 - 43:57.27] Hello Beverly,what have you got to say about witchcraft or the occult?Well,I found that there seems to be a real acceptance across the country,uh,going towards.Psychic ability.Supernatural Ability to foretell the future actually all grouped together in.The new age movement and there seems to be a real acceptability of that in.Well,what about in the schools?But I think what's happening.At the same time that this movement and it is being promoted at all,all,uh,levels of our country.What I'm finding is that there's becoming a,the teachers are becoming more and more aware of a growing problem.Involved in Satanism and I think having to take a look at that and just what Satanism is the fastest and most dangerous rising cult in the country,I think they're having to take a look at just what all that entails and uh having done 3 school districts now and.And training mental health and professionals across the country.I'm beginning to also see at the same time the,uh,the acceptance of the.And the ability to read minds and Ouija boards.I'm also seeing an awareness that perhaps,uh,these types of things might be leading the teenagers and the adolescents into an area of,of maybe some occult involvement that could cause them to commit criminal activities in order to appease their deity,which happens to be Satanism.Well,when you say you're engaging in training teachers,are you,uh,teaching them how to recognize,uh,what they may witness in the,in the children,and then perhaps turn it over to the authorities for possible criminal activity,or are you telling them,uh,how to deal with this in the classroom and alert the whole class?Basically I have done two entire school districts where I was allowed to go in with the.And also the teachers and the parents,uh,recently did an in-service for the school district in my area to help them recognize when an adolescent,because 98% of the children I'm bringing out of Satanism have been recruited after the age of 5 and below the age of 12,so that's not the ritual abuse and that's not the potpourri of teens getting involved in Satanism.This is actual recruitment of children,uh.On one by children of their own age orchestrated by an adult.So what I try to do is help them understand that the first beginning,the first onset of when an adolescent or a youth is being led into this area and how to catch it at the first onslaught,1st,2nd,3rd,and 4th levels,and whichever place that they find the youth at,who to turn to,where to go,and how to get help and get deprogramming going.Are you telling them that these things are bad and could be very harmful and might possibly be criminal?In other words,are you warning them to stay away?Oh yes,we've got children that are incarcerated because of the criminal activities.I've gone before the governor's advisory board on child abuse.Times last year and the last time I went before them,I asked for an investigative body in the state of California to be put together to determine the scope of the problem of criminal activities involved with the occult that range from graffiti to vandalism to network child abuse to pornography,contract murder,drugs,and they've had two hearings.They had one in San Francisco in December.They had one in.Ego on January 13th,and in fact the governor was presented with the entire packet approximately a month ago.About that terrible series of murders in Brownsville,Texas,where they finally ended up murdering a pre.Uh,students,and,ah,it apparently was quite a,quite a cult that had engaged in a whole series of murders.Yes,but at the same time,the danger was that he had infiltrated at a very high level wealthy family.And he was accepted.He,it was acceptable.He was into the,uh,same type of things I'm finding on one high school campus,which I will have to not mention in our area.Uh,they have,uh,for $370 you can take a class,uh,you can take courses on how to,how to put your own rituals together,how to start your own coven,a tarot card.Where do you take these courses?right on the campus.It's a club right on the high school campus.And so even though he was a course in a high in a high school in how to start a coven or to engage in witchcraft,exactly how to,how to read tarot cards,how to do crystal ball reading,how to do rituals,um,how are these courses listed in the catalog?Well,it's listed under the person presenting it is,uh,is a Druid high priestess,and she's,uh,she has several pages of who she.She's coming from And,uh,the fact that the school has allowed her to come on campus and actually start this club is extremely dangerous because it's open.Up into an area where they could possibly go into criminal activities involved with it.a game they're calling it white witchcraft.clubs,extracurricular clubs,or are they actual courses?It's a club that has actual courses,and they get credit for it and they get credit in some way.They've applied to it.I'm not exactly sure,so I,I would have to check into that.But for $370.Credit for it.I'm not sure if it's connected to the high school or if it's towards college credits,you know,one thing that Adam Walsh's group,uh,Pam Harrison Child Help,uh,Dan Sexton with Child Help USA and myself and several others,we called a press conference on the steps of the Board of Supervisors in Los Angeles when this came out about the metamor the the killings in Mexico.And the one thing that we all made statements is that this is what little children across the country have been trying to tell this nation,that these things have been going on.We have teenagers,we have adult survivors,and little children all saying the same thing across the country,and it's just time that we begin to ask questions of our PTAs,of our school districts,and we begin to ask,taking it out not as a religious issue.But it's a criminal issue and anyone out there that would like a packet of information,and I'll,I'll fly anywhere,speak anywhere,what I try to do is help the Christian community understand how to package this and take it out and demand that every single community begin to educate at all levels for mental health,uh,public health,uh.Social services Uh,law enforcement to recognize there is a,I am very concerned at the rising trend of criminal activities involved with the cult and extremely dangerous.Very much Beverly for calling and if you will send us your packet at Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002,uh,that information about how to get your resources will be available in our packet on
