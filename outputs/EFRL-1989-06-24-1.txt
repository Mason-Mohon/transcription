**spk_0:** [00:02.43 - 00:13.26] Do parents have the right to censor textbooks and films assigned to their children in public schools,or should schools have complete freedom to use any materials they want?

**spk_1:** [00:15.67 - 01:12.18] Some tough questions and with that we welcome you to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.I'm Bruce Hayes.Censorship in the public schools this week.How far do you go and what's happening on this issue across the United States?We'll be going to your telephone calls in the second half of this program,so jot down our toll-free number 1-800-736.3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.Whole string of new stations this week and we're excited about that.Peoria,Illinois,WPEO KOFC Fayetteville,Arkansas,W OLS Florence,South Carolina,and in Wheeler,Texas,there's KPDR and in Spokane,Washington,K U D Y.Every week we grow.This is exciting,you see.Parents need to know their rights and education.Thus this weekly call-in program,Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Hello Phyllis.

**spk_0:** [01:12.30 - 02:24.85] Hello Bruce.Anyone who has ever criticized materials used in public schools has probably had to face the cry of censorship.As soon as parents criticize immoral,offensive textbooks or films,they are probably labeled a censor or a book banner.Norman Lear's People for the American Way,which some people call People for Norman Lear's Way,issues a press release every year saying there's been a big increase in censorship.The national media put on radio and TV programs on censorship.They always pitch.Parents as censors against school personnel or librarians or authors or artists who are the ones supposedly advocating freedom,censorship has become a buzzword by which liberal writers,actors,and agitators get instant coverage on the media.Today we're going to ask the question,are parents censors when they speak up?Who is really doing the censoring?Is censorship a scare word to intimidate parents?Do schools have the right to subject pupils to any books,films.Or assignments without interference from the parents.And Phyllis,

**spk_1:** [02:24.93 - 02:36.96] we do have another expert on this matter.Our first guest on Phyllis-Schlafly Live is a professor at Cornell University and author of Censorship and the Public Schools.Richard Bear,

**spk_0:** [02:37.49 - 02:50.79] Doctor Bear,thank you for joining us today.Hello.Uh,you have written a booklet on censorship,and tell us,who do you think are the real censors in this ongoing debate about public school materials?

**spk_2:** [02:51.41 - 03:22.65] That's an awfully basic question,and I think the reason that we often are not able to answer it properly is we try to.Answer it apart from looking at the basic structure of the public schools.I,I would say if you look at the basic structure,we have to admit that many children are not in these schools because they or their parents choose to be there,but they're there because they really do not have the economic means to afford any other school.

**spk_0:** [03:22.99 - 03:48.98] Well,someone,I suppose,has to make the judgment call of what books and the materials are put in the schools,but,uh,I suppose we could.All agree that Playboy magazine is not a suitable material for elementary school education and once you concede that it seems to me uh it is a judgment call of what you put in rather than a matter of censorship or academic freedom.

**spk_2:** [03:49.32 - 04:30.42] I think basically that's correct that we do not allow minor children to choose their own textbooks and reading assignments.Everything they read,all the films they see,and so on.Really are preselected by teachers,and this is why the term censor is so often confusing because the term censor as it's appeared in The classical discussions really presupposes a free marketplace of ideas.The image really is that of the adult who is able to go to the newsstand or the library and choose what,uh,he or she wants to read.And that whole image,it seems to me,is just simply inappropriate for a monopoly.Compulsory school

**spk_0:** [04:30.42 - 04:45.10] system.Well,when the school picks,for example,uh,to read Romeo and Juliet instead of Merchant of Venice,and the parent has a different opinion,why is the one labeled censor and the other labeled freedom?Well,

**spk_2:** [04:45.14 - 05:12.56] I think that's the basic question.Certainly we do not want to be in a position where we define censorship by powerlessness.Really,what the parents are doing are disagreeing.They're protesting.They're objecting.They're saying that.Our worldview is different,and we believe that some of the things that you're assigning our children are causing them to Really reject the basic values and worldview that we're trying to teach them at home.

**spk_0:** [05:13.04 - 05:35.81] Well,what about the assumption that the people advocating so-called academic freedom usually make that say the child should be exposed to a multiplicity of values and that if the parent wants to restrict that uh array of different values,the parent is the censor and the school is the good guy.

**spk_2:** [05:36.44 - 06:36.87] I,as I mentioned in my little booklet on censorship,I think the problem with that is that usually when you present a multiplicity of values like that,the underlying assumption is that values are simply subjective in matters of personal choice.For instance,we don't normally present a multiplicity of scientific views.We don't,um,present astrology and phrenology and.Mainline science and then let the student choose and the assumption often behind that particular kind of diversity is that there are no objective values,no real rights or wrongs,and that this is the way you deal with it.I think this is a major kind of objection.That one properly ought to level against many of the sex education curricula and many of the methods like values clarification is they're really indoctrinating kids in a highly relativistic subjectivist view of values.There are no real rights and wrongs.

**spk_0:** [06:37.07 - 06:39.59] That's what we call values clarification,isn't it?

**spk_2:** [06:39.93 - 07:08.22] That's certainly one of the leading methods that has adopted that position.Now the kind of diversity that I argue for.is more the diversity that we would associate with terms like rainbow coalition or alphabet soup.I think we need a society that is truly pluralistic in the sense that Jews and Christians and humanists and others are free to choose those basic values and beliefs.that they want to teach to their children.

**spk_0:** [07:09.02 - 07:10.94] Well,can that be done in the public schools?

**spk_2:** [07:11.05 - 07:53.15] Well,that's the tough question.I think that at the very least,ah,public justice would demand that,uh,we offer some kind of choice to parents,uh,to go beyond the,the government,uh,public school,uh,as it is now,I,I think it's problematic.There are some parents who simply believe they can't find justice in the present schools.It's interesting in that respect that the 1948 United Nations,uh,The Universal Declaration of Human Rights says that one of those rights ought to be that parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.We simply don't respect that right in the United States.No,

**spk_0:** [07:53.84 - 07:54.46] we don't unless

**spk_2:** [07:54.46 - 07:59.19] you're affluent,unless you can afford.Uh,to pay for a second school system,

**spk_0:** [07:59.37 - 08:31.43] but why should the student who is a captive audience in the public school system and 89% of school children today are in the public schools,uh,why should they have to be subject to a teaching that is basically a humanist,uh,situation ethics,uh,the notion that one religion is as good as another and one moral code is as good as another and one type of sexual behavior is as good.another,all of which is highly offensive to people who think God already invented the moral law.

**spk_2:** [08:31.58 - 08:57.85] I think the answer is very simple.They shouldn't.And,and it's not just Christians and Jews who object.I have a graduate student,one of my best graduate students who's from a Jewish background but is an atheist.He's looked at some of the textbook materials,for instance,that were involved in the Alabama textbook trial where I was one of the expert witnesses.He was appalled by these,and he says,even as an atheist,even as a humanist.I certainly would not want my kids taught these things,

**spk_0:** [08:58.33 - 09:22.68] but bringing this down to the controversies that happen all the time in the public schools,uh,the,the whole curriculum is,is absolutely filled with this so-called value neutral approach,and when the parent objects to a book with uh uh explicit sexual.or anti-parent attitudes,the parent is called the censor or the book burner.

**spk_2:** [09:22.95 - 10:07.58] It's particularly ironic because the people who are requiring our children to be in those schools are basically saying we know what's best for your children and for everybody's children.We will require them by law,to be there unless they can afford an alternative education.And one of the things that happened,for instance,in the Alabama textbook trial.Was the media.Simply did not report fairly what went on because virtually every day of that trial,we said,uh,we are against,uh,in this case,even censoring textbooks.We said we would even settle for a solution where you at least gave equal time.To competing views.

**spk_0:** [10:07.91 - 10:09.69] Well,the parent,go ahead.No,

**spk_2:** [10:09.93 - 10:09.94] no,

**spk_0:** [10:10.27 - 10:27.18] the parents are always accused of trying to impose their values on other people's children.Would you think that the present situation in the public schools is precisely a matter of people,of people imposing their values on other people's children?Oh,there's no

**spk_2:** [10:27.18 - 11:16.00] question about it,and it rests on a basically false assumption.It rests on the assumption.That it's possible to have a genuine education and even to deal with the big questions about who we are and how we ought to live within a secular context and have that be religiously neutral.And there are just too many examples of where these curricula are highly biased.The fact that their so-called secular curricula,I think,doesn't help.For instance,values clarification basically teaches kids that the meaning of life is to satisfy themselves,to fulfill themselves,to direct their own lives.Now,why should the state Have the right to indoctrinate kids in that view when it directly contradicts the view of Jews and Christians,Muslims and others.

**spk_0:** [11:16.15 - 11:29.23] One of the problems is that the education establishment has set itself up as the experts and intimidates parents who are not professionals and supposedly don't know anything about what they're talking about.Yeah,

**spk_2:** [11:29.31 - 11:44.76] that's a serious problem.I've been involved personally in a lot of these disputes,and I'm just appalled.That's the way that many of the school administrators and the so-called experts have treated parents,often just slandering them with the most outrageous labels.

**spk_0:** [11:44.95 - 11:49.11] Do you have any special tips for dealing with this scare word called censorship?

**spk_2:** [11:49.39 - 12:46.15] Well,I think we,we have to continually point out that the structure of the school is such that it's just not an appropriate word to use at all,that the term censor.Ought to be used in terms of adults' access to ideas in a free market,that the,uh,public school is not an open forum of ideas.It's a very limited forum.Everything the children read is pre-selected and in a sense censored.So then to say that the school authorities are not censors,but the parents are,is just,uh,plain wrong and it's a particular insult.Because the parents are forced to have their children there.I think we have to continually point back to the structure of the school.I don't think most Christians in this country want to force their beliefs on other people through the public schools.I think they simply want the freedom.To teach their children what they believe is true.

**spk_0:** [12:46.43 - 13:03.63] That's why we in Eagle-Forum have distributed a little pamphlet called the Student Bill of Rights,uh,to phrase the whole subject in a way that shows that all most Christian parents,for example,are asking for is the same rights that the atheists and the humanists have established in

**spk_2:** [13:03.63 - 13:41.22] the the analogy that comes to me is that what if the government required all of us to,uh,eat in the same restaurant or cafeteria.And then said that if anyone is so foolish as to protest that she doesn't like a particular dish,that that person is out of line.Ah,my argument is that,ah,if you want to get rid of censorship,ah,let there be more choice.Let families be able to take charge of the education of their children.I don't think that most of us have any interest at all in forcing our ideas on other people,but we don't want them to brainwash our children.

**spk_0:** [13:41.79 - 14:07.25] Well thank you very much Doctor Bear for joining us today.Uh his,uh,pamphlet called Censorship and the Public Schools is available,and,uh,we thank you for throwing some light on this subject of censorship,uh,what the school establishment is trying to do.is in many cases creating a hostility toward the parents and imposing the humanist values on other people's children.

**spk_1:** [17:39.70 - 18:35.59] On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.We're addressing censorship in the public schools this week,and we're finding that many parents request tapes of our programs because the information we're bringing to the air is so enlightening.In fact,this program is good to have to maybe wake up some people to matters like this.If you'd like a cassette copy of this program,send $5 and request it.When you write Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.In fact,it's when you write for our materials and enclose a gift that we're able to stay on the air via satellite with Phyllis-Schlafly Live.In the second half of this program,we'll be going to your telephone calls,so you ought to jump in here into the conversation.We're at 1-800.736-3202 library board member in Oakland,Illinois is Nancy Zerwick,and she's our next guest for Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [18:35.74 - 19:01.01] Hello,Nancy.Thank you,Phyllis.How are you?Thank you for joining us today.Thank you for inviting me.Nancy is a courageous lady in a Chicago suburb who ran for the library board in her town.And some of the media tried to throw this epithet censor and book banner at her.Uh,what do you think,Nancy,of this word censorship,as it's often used to attack those who want to protect children from morally offensive materials?

**spk_6:** [19:01.20 - 19:17.44] Well,Phyllis,I think there are 3 points to consider with regard to the question of censorship.The first.The point would be the question of limiting materials.The second point would be a question of balance of materials.And the third question would be that of the use of children for any and all materials.

**spk_0:** [19:17.60 - 19:19.59] I think you better explain those points,Nancy.

**spk_6:** [19:19.67 - 20:01.35] Well,I think with the question of limiting materials,we have come to a point in our country where we see that the 1st Amendment has no limits.And,um,we realize that that is not true.Every freedom in our nation does have limits with regard to the First Amendment.We have limits with,uh,with regard to speech,uh,for libel,slander,perjury,and obscenity,etc.Uh,and I think that what Americans see today is an unlimited right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press.With regard to balance.What we see in,in many instances is that materials are being promoted to us in the country from what I would call from the middle to the left,and materials that would be from the middle to the right are very,very scarce or omitted.

**spk_0:** [20:01.81 - 20:25.07] Well,when the newspapers,uh,and radio stations.Call me and ask me for my comments on censorship.Uh,I always point out the big disparity in the feminist books in the libraries,uh,to those for me.For example,I know that when the biography of me came out,the Chicago Public Library bought 1 copy,but when Gloria Steinem's book came out,they bought 200 copies,

**spk_6:** [20:25.50 - 20:46.53] right?And I,I think this is the point I'm making with regard to balance.There the library Bill of Rights says that they.Will make all points of view available.The question is how are they doing that or are they really implementing their,their Bill of Rights?Um,another interesting point with censorship is just the term censor.When people hear that,Americans shudder and say,Well,my rights are being infringed upon.

**spk_0:** [20:46.66 - 20:47.72] That's right.It's a bad word.

**spk_6:** [20:48.48 - 20:54.61] It's the newspapers,when they decide what's going to go in print,they call that limitation of what they can put in print editing.

**spk_0:** [20:54.80 - 21:12.05] You mean,uh,this week.When,when,uh,CBS News put on both Chris Dodd and Marion Wright Edelman to tell you why we should have federal babysitting and didn't put on anybody at all to say why we should give parents tax credits for their children,that's a selection.

**spk_6:** [21:12.26 - 21:48.55] Well,that's true,but that's what they call editing because our point of view or the conservative point of view was not there.We would,we would,we would say that they were censoring the conservative position.TV and radio,when they decide what goes on the air,calls their,their process of selecting what we will,we will hear and what we will view programming.And libraries,when they decide what is going to be available in the local libraries,are called their process selective review.It is only the citizen who,who looks at what is available and says this has gone too far or this is not there and is omitted,that that particular individual or even a community for that matter,is labeled as a censor.

**spk_0:** [21:48.95 - 22:11.55] And since the liberal to left dominate the newspapers,TV,radio,and the libraries,uh,librarians organizations,it's,uh,most frequently,uh,the left wing view that gets aired or bought or written about.And the pro-family or conservative view expressed by the citizens that doesn't,doesn't get there.That's,

**spk_6:** [22:11.63 - 22:57.28] that's generally what's happening,um,I think that one of,one of the most frustrating policies that I see operating in the library is their their interpretation of the Bill of Rights with regard to children.Our libraries are saying that children can have free access to any and all materials.Now,our nation doesn't deal with children in that way.Uh,we say in Illinois specifically that children can't drive until they're 16.They can't see certain movies until they're 17.They can't vote until they're 18,and they can't drink until they're 21.The library policy is opting out of its responsibility.Their,their position is that it's up to the parents to be responsible for what the children will read or see.That's contrary to what goes on in our country with regard to any other government agency or business or organization.Well,

**spk_0:** [22:57.33 - 22:59.68] the liquor store certainly can't take that attitude.

**spk_6:** [22:59.80 - 23:49.96] That's right.But let's just take something much,much more simpler.Let's look at a child that,that is hurt,say,in a school or in a playground or in the neighbor's backyard.Is the parent the one that is held responsible because that child got hurt,or is it the people that are operating those,those various positions that I just mentioned?The library statement of,of,of having anything and everything available is,is completely contrary to the fact that they are public servants and that they have an obligation to protect our children.Now,our children may not be physically harmed from,from the things that are available,but they certainly can be psychologically damaged or hurt if,say,a child has access to materials and.suicide,drugs,porn,or safe sex materials or abortion,any of those things can psychologically damage a child.

**spk_0:** [23:50.20 - 24:04.10] We've had a number of complaints at our parents' advisory center about children going into the library and getting books on witchcraft and the occult,and libraries telling us that they're the ones most frequently taken out and kept out and not returned.

**spk_6:** [24:04.79 - 25:17.76] I think there's a solution to that policy of free access to all to all materials for children.Well,what is it?The way I would see it is that on every library card there would be a,a line that would be inserted on the card that would,would,would give the the parent,uh,the ability to sign and give permission for his.Her child to be able to have free access without that signature on the card,that child should be limited to children's materials.You know,years ago,the children never had access to all materials in the library.If you were a child and you know,I would to a certain age you had to remain in the children's section.This idea that just because a child can read something that they can handle the material is a total falsehood.And I like to use that,uh,in,in this reference.If we would show a 4 year old how to use matches and we,we,we demonstrate it to that child and then we place the matches up on a shelf that was is within reach of the child,that knowledge in and of itself is not damaging.However,for the child it is because the child does not have the life experience or the maturity to handle that knowledge and that's where the libraries are full.Have a falsehood with regard to free access to all materials.

**spk_0:** [25:17.95 - 25:29.71] Well,would you agree that since public libraries are spending public money,and a lot of public money,uh,they definitely should be subject to citizen surveillance over what they're doing?How much money does your library have to?

**spk_6:** [25:29.92 - 25:36.95] Our library has approximately $2 million.It's one of the,it's got a very large budget.It's one of the largest budgets in the South Side of Chicago.How big is

**spk_0:** [25:36.95 - 25:37.83] Oaklawn,your town?

**spk_6:** [25:38.07 - 25:39.68] 60,000 people.Well,

**spk_0:** [25:39.74 - 25:40.55] that's a lot of money.

**spk_6:** [25:40.62 - 25:42.34] That's correct.And um

**spk_0:** [25:43.02 - 25:49.50] well,when they buy magazines,are they buying the Phyllis-Schlafly Report and uh Human Events and Christian magazines?

**spk_6:** [25:49.54 - 26:08.82] That is a question that I think needs to be looked at.Um,I know that we,we have over 600 publications on,on of periodicals,and,um,I think that,that there is a question of how are the libraries implementing their own bill of rights,and I think it's up to us as citizens to get them to really do what they,what they claim they are doing,and that's presenting all points of view.

**spk_0:** [26:09.53 - 26:14.03] Well,how important do you think the libraries are in molding the opinions of young people?

**spk_6:** [26:14.20 - 27:00.70] I see 3 very important areas or,or,or areas out there that are influencing society and particularly our children.One is the media.Second is the schools,and the third is the library.Um,if you see the agenda that has been put forth on radio and television and the subject matters that are being covered,those ideas are still being carried down into the.School and when the school discusses those ideas and subject matters,then the child has to do research,so they go to they go to the public library.So I really believe that libraries play a very,very important part in forming the opinions of our children and can move us in a direction where the where the children can be separated from the,from the parents in in philosophy and thinking based on what they are reading and what they are.Forced to to research.

**spk_0:** [27:00.97 - 27:16.72] Well,thank you for taking on this task of the library.You're one of the very few people I've ever heard to discuss the problem of the phony charge of censorship or free access to the public libraries.Would you encourage other people to run for the library board?

**spk_6:** [27:16.93 - 27:30.60] I certainly would because now we're gonna get into a new area in the libraries,and that's called freedom to view.Libraries are now taking,um,as part of their collection video.And I think you,you can understand,um,exactly what,what kind of trouble and difficulty we're going to be having with,

**spk_0:** [27:31.71 - 27:34.53] can,can children go in and get these X-rated videos?

**spk_6:** [27:34.66 - 27:49.30] Well,they don't,to my knowledge,so far the libraries haven't gone into X-rated,but they are carrying R rated,and one of the northern suburbs in Chicago has recently limited the access of videos to children under the age of 18,but that was a very heated controversy.

**spk_0:** [27:49.63 - 27:53.18] Time,Nancy,thank you very much for sharing with us today.Thank you,Phyllis.

**spk_0:** [29:58.58 - 30:04.23] Well,I'll bet there are a lot of people out there,Bruce,who've been called a censor when they dared to speak up about some offensive textbook.

**spk_1:** [30:04.63 - 30:12.66] Let's find out.Let's.Go to Oklahoma City and it's Trina on KQCV,the Quality Christian Voice of Oklahoma City.Hello,

**spk_0:** [30:12.74 - 32:32.52] Trina.Hello Phyllis.Have you been called a censor?Yes,I have.Well,tell us about it.Well,um,I was successful.Me and some other parents were successful in getting out of the what was considered to be a self-esteem program called Punsi in Pursuit of Excellence.And immediately in the newspaper and also on one of the other local radio stations,I was called a censor because I was,you know,censoring my,uh,everybody,not just my child,but everybody in the classroom from receiving this,uh,what supposedly is the self-esteem program.Of course the people who censored out good materials and put Pumpsy in were not called censors,right?That's right.They didn't say anything about the.You know that we send our children to be taught math and spelling and English and they don't seem to realize that when they put in a program like this that it's taking out,it is replacing some kind of subject that is,that is why we're sending our kids to school.Were you successful?What did you do?Well,I went through the process.I first,I had to go through the,uh,local school first and I just sent,filled out a form and also got the curriculum and wrote out all my objections.And then I turned that in to the to the classroom,uh,to the school,to the principal,and then she got a committee together and there were 3 other teachers and her,and,uh,then from there it went,and I don't know what the count was,but anyway they said that it was OK to leave in the school,but this was first of all,tell me in about one sentence,what was it you objected to about this program?Well,there was a lot.Of new age it was a lot of imagery what they called mind pictures and they went out and they were supposed to imagine a field and then in the field and of course they go into great detail and they go into the field and then they can imagine a pond.They tell them to close their eyes and relax and then even at the end they say things like now you can come to this anytime you want.Nobody can prevent you from So I suppose you,you felt it was new age guided imagery and anti-parent.So they set up a committee and they decided they wanted to keep it and then what?Then after then you appeal to the district committee and then they,that's where they select 10 people and that is usually that's 8 people that are employed by the district like principals and teachers and

**spk_6:** [32:32.52 - 32:34.24] then there were supposedly 2.

**spk_0:** [32:35.04 - 33:26.14] Well,I guess,I guess they were hoping that you'd be worn out by now,but you persisted,and then what,right?And that vote was 7 to 3.So there were 3 of those people that did not want the program,but because it was approved,then they,and even in that they told me the things that they wanted out,and a lot of the stuff that they wanted out was the program,you know,so why they would approve a program to get to take out certain parts of it,I don't understand.So what happened after that then?I had to take it to the board and when it went to the the Putnam City school board,then it was voted 3 to 2 to take it out.They felt like it was new age and it was very humanistic and it was anti-family.Well,congratulations.That that was a great victory and it does show that if you persist despite all those committees and beside despite their telling you that you're a censor,you can be successful and protect your.Children,thanks for calling.We got another call,

**spk_1:** [33:26.22 - 33:32.99] Bruce.We're at 1-800-736-3202.It's Karen in Texarkana,Texas.Hi Karen.

**spk_0:** [33:33.90 - 33:36.90] Hello,hello Karen.Were you called a censor?

**spk_1:** [33:37.18 - 33:37.52] Well,

**spk_0:** [33:37.82 - 36:37.03] I'm just now in the beginning.Uh,two other families and I have begun finding some required reading books in our school and some sex ed puppet programs for the elementary that we have had problems with.Our question is we feel rather isolated.Our question is how do we involve other parents?How do we contact them?How do we inform them?And then some of the parents that we have made aware of this,they've gone to the schools before and they've been shut down and they don't want to get re-involved.Our question is,is how do we Get the word out to the parents as to what is going on.I would say you find some friends who share your views and your values.A good place to start would be in your church.It is important that when you go to the school,you have other people who support your view.It takes a very strong person to try to fight this battle alone.And that is very seldom successful,uh,the school will begin to respond when they see that there are a number of people who are upset about a particular program so you can show uh the materials that you object to around other parents and,uh,then,then you can go together to the schools.OK.Is it better to go as a group or as individuals?I think it's better to go 2 or 3 at the first time,uh,in order that,uh,you don't have too many people talking.But when you have a school board meeting,it's important to bring lots and lots of people,all that you can get.I heard about a school.board meeting objecting to a sex ed program last week in Virginia Beach where they drew a crowd of 1500.Now that really has an impact on the school when they know that that many people are upset.OK,my other question is this required reading book that was given to my daughter,she was given.Alternate reading material to read,but I'm still not satisfied with that because of the profanity and the,uh,obscenity in this book.I don't feel like any of the children should be reading it.Am I wrong in pursuing to try to get the book removed?No,you're not wrong.You're right,uh,in pursuing it,but the thing to do is to find others who share your views.It's one matter when you're trying to speak.Up on behalf of your own child,but when you're starting to,uh,to,uh,talk about taking the book out,you then need to have the support of other parents who share your views.Uh,there are a lot of books that are really unacceptable.Many of them are age inappropriate and,uh,for any book that is,uh.That has uh material that you think is is not acceptable,you should strive for a policy of getting prior parental consent to read the book.Uh,it's also a matter of whether it is a required reading book or whether it's a supplementary reading book.OK,I have one other question.How long once we have made a formal complaint to the school and and written our letters to the school and to the board,how long should we wait before we recontacting?Well,if,if it's a letter and you haven't gotten an answer in a week,I'd call them up and ask when are you going to get an answer.

**spk_6:** [36:37.36 - 36:38.86] OK,well this has been about 6 weeks.

**spk_0:** [36:39.01 - 37:04.74] Yes,well,call them up and ask when you're going to get an answer and then call back.I think it's important that you,uh,approach it with,uh,with kindness and,uh,uh,not as though it is a hostile situation,but.You are speaking up for the rights of your child,and you can be firm,but get a group together to go with you,and I think you will be more successful.

**spk_1:** [37:04.86 - 37:05.74] OK,thank you.

**spk_0:** [37:05.95 - 37:06.78] Have we got another call,

**spk_0:** [37:34.45 - 37:54.66] Well,indeed it is the most powerful influence in the schools today,and we're going to talk about that next week,Bruce,uh,it isn't the association itself that makes the decisions,but it's members of the association who serve on all the curriculum committees and in administrative posts in the schools.We'll talk more about that next week.It's a very interesting.You know,

**spk_1:** [37:54.75 - 40:00.41] I'd be curious to find out what kind of role the parents can play with the National Education Association.Can they go in on any of their meetings?There are a number of questions that can be raised on that matter,and indeed we will talk about that next week.And last week we were talking about sex education.We have that packet of.Available to you,sex education information and information on this week's program.This week's program,censorship in the public schools.We certainly invite you to write us.We're at Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.You see,it's your gifts that help us stay on the air.On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,inviting your telephone calls.1-800-736-3202.We will return.If you're serious about understanding education issues,you need to subscribe to the Education Reporter.The Education Reporter helps keep you informed about what public schools are doing throughout the United States.Find out about the alarming new age courses being taught in Alabama public schools.Did you know in a community college in New York State,students can now watch pornography for credit?Stay informed on education legislation.The education reporter is a Monthly publication that's available to you.How about writing to Eagle-Forum for your annual subscription?In fact,the education reporter would make a great gift idea for someone you know in the field of education.Send $25 to Eagle-Forum Education.Eagle is spelled like the American Eagle.Eagle-Forum Education,Alton,Illinois,62002.Alton is spelled A L T O N,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [41:02.62 - 41:11.75] Phyllis-Schlafly live on the USA Radio Network.Let's jump right back to the telephone calls.It's Marie,top of Texas,KPDR.

**spk_0:** [41:12.75 - 41:17.52] Hello Marie.Yes,have you had some experience with censorship?

**spk_7:** [41:17.79 - 41:24.90] Yes ma'am,I have.Tell us about it.OK,I'm listening on the radio and it's behind what we're saying here.

**spk_0:** [41:25.03 - 41:27.97] Yes,well,turn your radio down so you can talk to us on the phone.

**spk_7:** [41:29.51 - 42:01.29] I had a problem with a history teacher.My son brought a paper home,and I've read it was a manual graph page.And it was really,I thought sexual deal.It turned out the Indians had done this to the whites,so the whites were retaliated and done it to the Indians was the first,uh,paper that we had received.And,uh,it's talking about that they cut off the women's breasts and used them for over their saddle horns and that they used the men's privates for tobacco pouches.And all this,and I thought,well,that was really something that he needed to know in history,you know what

**spk_0:** [42:01.29 - 42:02.12] grade was this?

**spk_7:** [42:02.26 - 42:05.42] This is the would be the 10th grade.

**spk_0:** [42:06.03 - 42:11.59] Well,with all the history there is to learn,it doesn't seem like they need to be that explicit.Well,

**spk_7:** [42:11.63 - 42:47.71] that's what I was thinking.He really had to go some to find something like this.And then the next thing we encountered was this story,uh,East of Eden.I understand that this is a acquired reading for college.East of Eden,uh-huh,and it's a paper talking about the English.I don't know.I didn't even read it all.It was so it had God's name in vain all through it.He came in to ask me,uh,about the first question,you know,the first question didn't make sense.And I said,well,I'll have to read through here a little bit and see,you know,and I got to read them through there and I couldn't believe it.I just went in total shock the words that was in there,the SOD and GD and everything.And uh

**spk_0:** [42:48.06 - 42:50.09] have you tried talking to the teacher about this?Yes,

**spk_7:** [42:50.15 - 42:56.23] at 10 o'clock at night my husband called the school principal and then the school principal had the teacher call us back.

**spk_0:** [42:56.87 - 42:57.44] And what did he say?

**spk_7:** [42:57.77 - 43:03.51] He said 22 years of teaching using these same papers that we were the first parents that had ever complained about this.

**spk_0:** [43:03.61 - 43:18.50] Do you know that's what everybody's told?We,we hear that every day at our parents' advisory.No matter who the parent is,they always tell you you're the first one who ever complained,and that's why we have this radio program,so you'll know that there are other people who are experiencing the same thing.

**spk_7:** [43:18.76 - 43:51.69] I,you know,I didn't want to have another paper like that brought into our home,and then my child would not answer questions or be responsible for answering anything like that.I said we've got paid textbooks that are reviewed.And you know,supposedly to,to,to delete things like that,you know,and,uh,so he,uh,first,uh,doubted that it even had those words in there,wanted us to repeat them over the phone.And I told him I said,Well,if I do,you better not go back to the principal and tell him that we were cursing you on the phone by using these words,telling you his words,you know.

**spk_0:** [43:52.08 - 43:55.65] Oh well,I don't think that's a good idea.I don't think you should have repeated those words on the phone.

**spk_7:** [43:55.81 - 43:57.69] Well,that's what,you know,and,and that could have

**spk_0:** [43:57.69 - 43:57.81] been

**spk_7:** [43:57.81 - 43:57.96] a

**spk_0:** [43:57.96 - 43:58.31] setup.

**spk_7:** [43:58.57 - 44:20.08] He's a Christian man,you know,and,and sings in the church choir at the church we go to and everything,and I told him I said that's not too good for those children to see you up there in the choir.And you're handing out papers like this in school,and he first told me,he said,Well,he just put my son in a separate class by himself,you know,and I said,No,you're not going to do that.I said that would make him feel inferior,you know,or something wrong with him.

**spk_0:** [44:20.32 - 44:28.96] You're absolutely right.Well,we,we believe that your child has got a right to be in the classroom and not have his religion or values assaulted like that.So what did he say?Well,

**spk_7:** [44:29.00 - 44:51.64] I told him,I said,I'll get enough parents together and stuff to,you know,get this stopped or go to the school.I'll go as high as I need to go to get it stopped,you know.So it apparently did stop.I don't know,but when I went to some of the other parents to talk to them about it,I was in total shock their reaction,you know,they were so unconcerned,you know,like,oh well,my kid will have it in college,no big deal.They know all this already.

**spk_0:** [44:52.63 - 44:55.42] Well,a lot of parents don't care.That's perfectly true.Well,

**spk_7:** [44:55.57 - 45:01.56] I went to the First Baptist minister's once,and I was,I mean I went to both of them that next morning.

**spk_0:** [45:03.54 - 45:06.37] Did they,did they support you?Did they support you?

**spk_7:** [45:06.62 - 45:29.08] No,they didn't even have time to talk to me about that.She was fixing to have her,uh,class over there,her,uh,circle deal.And she needed the test and she had to assign the same grade as mine,so I know he had the same paper.But when I talked to called several parents that night.They couldn't find the paper or the child wouldn't show them the paper or whatever.

**spk_0:** [45:29.41 - 45:43.21] Well,it is true that a lot of parents don't care,but there are many others who do care,and I think that if you would write for our packet at Eagle-Forum,uh,we have some very important material.that would tell you and advise you how to deal with this.Well,Phyllis.I wanted to tell you,

**spk_7:** [45:48.52 - 46:50.28] uh,the other day when I went to the school for another deal,uh,our children rodeo,and we,we're trying to now in the rodeo,uh,my husband is getting a.You know,religious Well for the high school rodeos,but I had to go get the children's grades,you know,for all them to go rodeo,and,uh,I encountered the English teacher there,and my son failed English by 1 point,made a 69 for the year,and passed all his other grades in real good shape,you know.So when I questioned her about it,she said,Well,it's because he didn't turn his papers in.He didn't read books during then turn the papers in.Well,come to find out what it was,was that the Scarlet Letter,they were required to read that in school,and I told her I said,no,he's not reading that and he's not reporting on it.I said,you know,it's too bad that he had to fail,but I said I'm proud of him for not doing it.And I said,uh,you know,and another one that they require them to read here is Of Mice and Men,and to me that's the nastiest,filthiest book that ever could be written.Well,well,

**spk_0:** [46:50.32 - 47:11.78] with all the wonderful books there are available,it is just incomprehensible to me why they would not give an alternate book to your child when you find something that offends your religion.And so I hope you find out about it in time before the course is over and quietly,firmly demand an alternate reading.Thank you very much for calling,Marie,

**spk_1:** [47:11.90 - 47:17.82] and we have literally one more minute.Let's squeeze in another telephone call.We go to Fanwood,New Jersey.Here's Tom.

**spk_8:** [47:18.10 - 48:05.81] Oh boy,I have one minute.I have so much to say.Talk fast,Tom.All right,I'm thrilled that you're on the air because we're experiencing the same thing in New Jersey,and I say the town.Yeah,sure.Fanwood Scotch Plains school system.Um,we,we,uh,our son had to read a book,had no alternative.What else to read.There's very descriptive promiscuity and all kinds of things in there.We contacted the school.We had to fill out a lengthy report and wait months and months to,to sit before a school board and go through votes and all this to get it out of the school.Meanwhile,he was not given an option to read anything else.And we wound up,thank God he gave us wisdom for a temporary measure,and that was to black out the parts in the book with a black magic marker that were offensive.But it's unbelievable what they expect.9th graders.

**spk_0:** [48:06.11 - 48:15.27] Well,thank you very much for sharing this with you,Tom.I wish we had more time to talk to you about it.I'm glad you at least got the offensive passages marked out.And on the USA
