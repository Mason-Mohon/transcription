**spk_0:** [00:01.08 - 00:10.42] Public school students used to be taught history,geography,and civics.Now they have a mishmash called social studies,and parents wonder what they are learning.

**spk_1:** [00:12.06 - 00:50.23] Live via satellites on the USA Radio Network.This is Philly Schlafly Live.Welcome along,this is Bruce Hayes,and of course,we're inviting your telephone calls.So mark down our toll-free number from anywhere in America.1-800-736-3202.Do you have questions about what your children are learning in their social studies classes?What does that subject mean?As a whole,is there a specific course of study for social studies,and is there a bias to the way the subject is taught?Well,today we have a guest in the studio who will be taking your calls right after the first segment of the program.

**spk_0:** [00:50.35 - 01:26.23] Our guest today is Donna Hearn,a longtime student of educational curricula and a member of the Fund for the Improvement and Reform of Schools and Teaching.It's known in form.as first,uh,Donna was previously a Reagan appointee to the National Council on Educational Research,so she's been deep into the subject for many years.Last month,Donna attended the national convention of the National Council of Social Studies.That's a convention of social studies teachers all over the United States,and that's where you'll find out about current trends in social studies teaching.Welcome Donna.

**spk_2:** [01:26.75 - 01:28.68] Thank you Phyllis.It's a pleasure to be here.

**spk_0:** [01:28.96 - 01:40.26] Well,we're very happy to have you join us today and to answer the calls of,uh,from our listeners a little bit later in the program,but first tell us just a bit about this education commission that you serve on.Well,

**spk_2:** [01:40.40 - 02:32.07] first is one of.Many different,uh,organizations,groups,programs,whatever in the Department of Education.It was established by Congress,a year and a half ago,authorized,and it was to come up with innovative ideas in education.And as most of our listeners know,the federal government's,uh,long suit in education has been research dollars.This is one of those programs,Phyllis,in which,uh,your tax money is going to be spent for programs that are being tried in the different schools throughout the country.My,my job in the Department of Education is to work with the department and the people that apply for those programs.And hopefully make sure we have good programs,things that are going to help the children instead of hurt the children.

**spk_0:** [02:32.20 - 02:38.84] Well,I thought it was against the law for the federal government to be involved in developing curricula for the public schools.That's a local matter.

**spk_2:** [02:39.00 - 03:11.97] Well,you must have been reading a textbook or a government publication about 20 years ago,Phyllis.Yes,it's probably against the law still on the books.Uh,they don't call it curriculum development,but if you look very carefully at what Education Weekly is saying.And you read the education publications on a very steady diet,you're seeing that we're moving rapidly towards a national curriculum and in order to get to a national curriculum,you have to have the kinds of programs that are being done right now through the department so that you have something to start with.

**spk_0:** [03:12.21 - 03:17.19] Well,tell us about this convention you went to last month,uh,because we want to talk about social studies today.

**spk_2:** [03:17.53 - 04:05.29] Well,this is a very interesting convention.It was the sixty-ninth National Council for Social Studies convention.It met here in Saint Louis November 10th through 13th.Uh,they said that it's at the Adams Mark and the Clarion Hotel,although I realized that they had people stashed throughout hotel rooms all over the city.I have no idea how many people.It was in the multi-thousands,the teachers that were there.But,uh,the interesting thing,Phyllis,is that if you really want to know where they're going,this is the flagship.These are the leaders in the social studies area.These are the ones.that are telling the rest of the social studies teachers,this is the issue,this is where we're headed.And so I brought with me today the program that was put out that I think you'll find very interesting.Well,did they

**spk_0:** [04:05.29 - 04:11.95] have workshops and sessions and lectures on different subject matter that is taught within the social studies discipline?

**spk_2:** [04:12.72 - 04:31.16] Yes,and interestingly enough,as you go through the entire catalog,Phyllis,there was very little on geography.Now the National Geography.Uh,National Geographical Society had a booth there and they did have a workshop,but there was not a lot of concentration on what we would know as geography.

**spk_0:** [04:31.44 - 04:44.77] Well,there's been a whole lot of comment recently about how deficient Americans.on that.In fact,I saw one survey that said a certain percentage of high school graduates cannot find the United States on an outline map of the world.

**spk_2:** [04:44.91 - 05:33.01] Well,that's exactly right.In fact,I went into this conference thinking,well,I wonder what they're going to do about that because we've certainly seen it in the news that people are not knowledgeable about these areas.So I thought,well,I'm going to find out.Uh,in going through the different exhibits,and going through looking at the different workshops,and literally,P Phyllis,there were hundreds of workshops,so there's no way one person could go to all of them.So what you had to do was to pick and choose.I went to several of the workshops and I was not able to attend some of the more interesting ones because some of them were at the same time,but the thesis,Phyllis,is global education,interdependence,one world.We're moving rapidly towards this.We must prepare the child for a world citizenship instead of a citizenship of the United States.

**spk_0:** [05:33.09 - 05:50.73] Well,Don,I explained what's the matter with globalism because certainly a great deal of history is.In other places around the world and certainly a great deal of geography is in other places around the world and we do want our young people to know what went before in other countries and where other countries are.Well,

**spk_2:** [05:50.80 - 06:11.90] that is a very accurate comment,Phyllis,and I would certainly say that most of our teachers,and again I say this all the time,most of our teachers in our classrooms today are well-intentioned,meaningful people who do care for kids,and they're trying to do the best they can.However,they are only.Allowed to do what the school district gives to them as far as curriculum.

**spk_0:** [06:12.09 - 06:12.34] In other

**spk_2:** [06:12.34 - 06:12.58] words,

**spk_0:** [06:12.66 - 06:14.37] the teachers do not select the textbooks.

**spk_2:** [06:14.50 - 07:35.51] Teachers do not select the textbooks.Uh,basically,the board,the school boards don't select the textbooks.Your administrators and your directors of curriculum,and it's interesting to note for those who are listening in the St.Louis area that the head honcho of the social studies teacher is the or has been the director of curriculum for the Parkway School District.And so you,you see this thesis running through of the people that are selecting the curriculum have high positions in this particular organization,but you know,getting back to your question,Phyllis,about what is wrong with,with learning about the world,there's nothing wrong.We've all learned about the world in the past as we went through schools,uh,probably one of the easiest things that I could use as an illustration is that that's not what it's all about today.It's not just learning about.World places events and happenings,it's learning about things that make you feel like you're similar to another to another nation so that you can become one.In other words,we're learning all about the things that we can all find agreements about so we can have a happy,peaceful world and with that then there will be a move that uh we don't have to worry about boundaries anymore.Certainly,you know,we're in a society today that is.So fast moving that that boundary lines are,are,are being removed.

**spk_0:** [07:35.63 - 07:58.73] Well,do you think,uh,this type of teaching is perhaps the reason for these interesting articles that have been in the news in the last few weeks showing that the young people in schools are not a bit interested or impressed with the tearing down of the Berlin Wall?I guess they didn't even know it was there,and they did and they don't know or don't have any comprehension of how different life is on one side of the Berlin Wall and on the other.

**spk_2:** [07:59.49 - 08:13.11] I would think that's very much part of it,Phyllis.I,I think too that we've got to go and look at what the whole,uh,teaching of social studies has been through the last 20 to 30 years because we're dealing with that generation now that have had that.And if you

**spk_0:** [08:13.37 - 08:19.74] would you,would you say that social studies.Came in to replace history,geography,and civics about 20 years ago.

**spk_2:** [08:19.92 - 09:39.08] Oh,probably longer than that.It's,it's,it's been a gradual movement towards replacing history,as the word goes,uh,and,and a good illustration would be some of the textbooks,for instance,in,in grade school,um,you don't have,I,I remember when I was in grade school,we,I can go back and tell you right now,in the 4th grade we studied Mexico.And uh in the 5th grade,we studied the United States.And so we had certain areas that were historically the areas of concentration and by the time I,I came out of grade school,I had covered the world.We knew what the countries were all about,we knew where they were,uh,we knew their history,and it was done in a lot.sequence you look at any of the books that are used today in the classroom and indeed all you had to do was walk through these exhibits and look at the sample textbooks they're all over the map.There's no chronological order with them.There is no geographical order with them even in the United States books,the books uh teaching the children about our own country.Uh,there is no way that a child can form any kind of threads of the past,the present,and the future because they're so poorly organized and the facts that they give them are so out of context that it's very difficult for a child today to come up with a grasp of truly where have we been as a nation,where have we been as a world?

**spk_0:** [09:39.27 - 09:56.87] Well,do you think this is uh deliberate or or due to incompetent people doing it?Or perhaps because what they really want to teach is not a geographic or chronological order,but perhaps is a message that is behind this whole teaching of social studies.

**spk_2:** [09:57.00 - 10:33.77] Well,I think the conference Phyllis pointed out there's a message and what is that message?The message again is that,uh,the world,it is based on the humanist philosophy and again a worldview dictates how you teach things and the worldview.Of most of the leadership of the social studies people is that it is a view that uh man is no different from the animals and that uh there is a lot of things happening in this world and if we don't quickly get everybody in order,we're going to self-destruct.And so there is almost a religious fervor to reorder this world so that it doesn't disappear.

**spk_0:** [10:33.91 - 10:35.63] Well,what kind of order do they want?Well,

**spk_2:** [10:35.74 - 10:47.89] of course it has to be,they don't use the word totalitarian,but essentially that's it,because they,they base it on the philosophy that these people in the world are just too dumb to know what's best.Um,as Senator Fulbright,

**spk_0:** [10:48.69 - 10:49.09] elite,

**spk_2:** [10:49.46 - 11:44.87] an elite,yes,an elite group should decide,and as a good example,on Saturday at the,um,conference,uh,general session,their topic from 10:30 to 12,uh,this is the general session,mind you,not just one of the workshops,was citizenship in the 21st century.And one of the lead speakers was Peter Raven,who is the director of the Missouri Botanical Gardens here in Saint Louis,and his topic was citizenship in a global environment,the significant environmental issues facing citizens in the 20th century,21st century.And I know,Phyllis,you've talked about the new age materials that are in the classroom and the environmental movement.This is all part and parcel.See,Mother Earth is taking on a significance,and we must preserve Mother Earth,you know,don't worry about the aborted babies.We must preserve Mother Earth,and we must have this whole Earth working together so that we don't self-destruct.And so you saw that thesis.

**spk_0:** [11:45.15 - 12:03.78] Well,when you talk about your,your worldview.Uh,being the basis for the teaching,uh,it does make a difference whether you look upon,uh,the earth as here to serve man or whether you think that the man should subordinate his,uh,well-being to the,the inanimate earth around us.Well,

**spk_2:** [12:04.01 - 12:26.06] that's exactly the difference.What you saw at that conference was that,uh,man is to be subjected to the environment,not that man is created in the image of God.And I think the easiest thing to look at is,is some of the presenters.Uh,one of the presenters was zero population control.Now they,they certainly had an unbiased,uh,workshop on population.

**spk_0:** [12:26.30 - 12:37.50] Well,they think that,uh,we've,we've got to cut down on,on people so that the Earth can,uh,uh,survive with all of its,uh,uh,it's plants and animals and everything else,

**spk_2:** [12:37.75 - 13:00.38] right,and their whole philosophy.is that there's the more the people,the more destruction of the earth.And so,as you say,cut back on the people.However,that's not historically accurate.You can look at Hong Kong,you can look at London,you can look at Taiwan,and you can certainly see heavy concentrations of people and very thriving prosperous areas.So they're not always exactly honest with some of their facts.

**spk_0:** [13:00.57 - 13:21.61] No.And,and most of the places where people are hungry,they are hungry and have Famine because of political reasons,not population reasons and not economic reasons,and Ethiopia is a good example of that because Ethiopia was a grain exporter before the communists took over and started starving everybody.Now do they tell you this kind of thing in the,

**spk_2:** [13:21.72 - 13:31.23] as a matter of fact,no,um,in fact,I've got materials in front of me showing,uh,one page,uh,descriptions of countries and you read that,Phyllis,and you sure don't get what you just said.

**spk_0:** [13:31.65 - 13:54.07] Well,we're talking with uh Donna Hearn who recently attended,uh,the national convention of the National Council of Social Studies Teachers,and this is where she has picked up the trends,the ideas,the concepts that is that are being taught in social studies,uh,around the country.You ought to know so that you can be on guard from the textbooks you're.Children are given in schools.Phyllis,

**spk_1:** [13:54.16 - 14:33.47] we're going to have a lot of calls today because I know Donna hosts a local program here on our flagship station KSIV.She talks about this issue and lots of other issues on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.We're visiting with Donna Hearn.And how about your child's social studies classes?What do you think about this whole?today.Well,come on in.We want to hear from you.We'll pick up the tab on the telephone call anywhere in America.1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.It wouldn't be the program without you on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_3:** [14:37.85 - 15:37.01] Child abuse in the classroom.You've heard callers on radio Live with Phyllis Schlaffly mention it many times.It is the best tool for explaining the changes that have occurred in education in the last 15 years and contains actual testimony from parents,students,and educators given at 7 regional US Department of Education hearings.Over 200,000 copies of child abuse in the classroom have been sold.Read a copy yourself and give one to a friend.Or if you want to inform those who don't have time to read,buy the video tape which is narrated by Phyllis.The best way to alert your community to the problems in the public schools is to show this video to a group of your friends.Order your copy of Eagle Forum's Child Abuse in the Classroom,the book for 495,or the video for 2195.Write Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.That address again is Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.

**spk_4:** [15:37.82 - 16:35.25] December 7th,1941.A date which will live.In infamy,we believe that all men are created equal,yet many are denied equal treatment.We proposed the most sweeping and generous arms control proposal in history.We offered the every president has had to face tough decisions in his term of office.Many discussed them with their vice president,members of their cabinet and Congress.Other presidents have consulted court decisions or sought advice from special advisors.But only one thing has influenced every presidential decision made in the history of the United States,and that's the Constitution.The Constitution,the words we live by.To receive a free copy of this great document and information about it,write Constitution,Washington DC 200063999.A message from the commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution and the Advertising Council.

**spk_1:** [16:36.29 - 16:58.18] On the USA Radio Network,this is Philly Schlafly Live.Are your children being taught history,geography,and civics the way you'd like them to be taught?Well,that's what we're addressing here today,and our toll-free number from anywhere in America,1-800-736-3202.Couple quick calls right off the bat.What do you say in Saint Louis over KSIV?Here's Debbie.

**spk_0:** [16:58.27 - 17:01.33] Hello Debbie.What is your question?Well,

**spk_5:** [17:01.45 - 18:00.38] I kind of have a question,um,and a statement.Uh,my children go to District number 70 here in Saint Clair County,and they have been taught a wide variety of things from the fact that they could have their sex changed if they weren't pleased with how they were born in 4th grade.They were taught that they were taught in 3rd grade by a teacher that,um,the truth meant nothing,only what,what their opinion of something was,that they didn't need to follow what their parents said.Um,they've been taught all kinds of strange things like in 6th grade my son was taught to drink blood from a skull because he was taught about Notre Dameus,and my husband and I complained very peacefully and,and Christian in a Christian manner,and we were called troublemakers,and we finally,you know,it just seems as though you have to just give up because they're going to keep doing this no matter how kind and how you protest,even peacefully,and it just seems like it's so taken over.That there's nothing to do but go to a Christian school.We just finally gave up

**spk_0:** [18:00.59 - 18:03.22] and put your children in a Christian school.We were overwhelmed.

**spk_5:** [18:03.33 - 18:03.70] Yes,

**spk_0:** [18:04.03 - 18:32.41] well,I'm glad you called,Debbie,because that's the problem that's out there and we receive calls like yours all the time.Unfortunately,the parents are frequently treated with great hostility by the schools,and I think,uh,the big majority of parents still do not know that such off the wall things are being taught as what you described.So,um,I congratulate you for taking care of your children.And,and watching over what they are being taught and uh thank you for sharing this with others.Donna,do you have some comments?

**spk_2:** [18:32.44 - 18:49.79] I would,I would suggest,Debbie,that,uh,yes,get your children into another environment and know so that you know what they're getting,but I would also recommend that you stay in there and fight in the public schools because 89% of the kids are in the public schools and if we totally abandon them,we're not going to,we're not going to have any kind of a future.

**spk_1:** [18:49.93 - 19:05.65] And this conversation is sparking a lot of telephone calls.So just a clue here when you hear somebody.Hang up like right now it's the best time to jump in at 1-800-736-3202.Let's move on to Houston,Texas over KTEK.Von Lynn.

**spk_0:** [19:05.66 - 19:07.44] Hello,Lynn,what is your question?

**spk_6:** [19:08.22 - 19:52.65] Well,I,I taught in the public schools for eight years,and from a teacher's point of view,here's what I see is they're not paying teachers a whole lot,OK?And,um,I mean,I agree with what y'all are saying.I'm not teaching in the public schools right now,but.What my experience was is that they don't pay very much and but they expect you to teach all these different subjects in order to be creative about it you have to.Come up with a lot of your own materials and so when the globalists or whoever's trying to push materials into teachers' hands,it's like,yeah,give me anything because I don't have anything for this subject and it,you know,includes social studies,it's like,well,you've got to have something to supplement the textbook to make it interesting for the students.

**spk_0:** [19:52.77 - 20:04.52] Well,now wait a minute,uh,you were given certain goals for all the courses,uh,which are not decided by the teachers,and then you're given a textbook to teach from.Uh,why do you need to go out and create something else?

**spk_6:** [20:04.99 - 21:04.18] Well,it's not so much that I have to create anything else.It's just that A lot of times,um,you know,there will be suggestions in the,in the back of the textbook and.You know,you try to get as many ideas as you can to make it interesting for the students,and you know,unfortunately at the time I wasn't a real committed Christian and I'm just giving you a teacher's viewpoint to kind of let you know where a lot of teachers I think are coming from because there's just a lot of times,um.You know,the ideas in the textbook might you,you might figure,well,they're not going to capture the student's imaginations and you know a lot of the ideas are very good,but then a lot of times you'll get a supplementary materials,um,that,that seem really interesting and,and,you know,the students might really.Latch onto.So I'm not just saying it's for social studies.I'm saying that,you know,for any subject area you just try to find free materials.That was the key word free.

**spk_2:** [21:04.32 - 21:45.23] Yeah,Lynn,I might jump in here and say my husband's head of a history department in a Christian school and even in that situation he has to do an extensive amount of collection of materials and,uh,if you're going to teach it the right way and you're going to be a good teacher.Teacher unfortunately that's what's going to have to be done and,uh,Phyllis,uh,has an education reporter newsletter that comes out once a month and it's a good place to start to find out some of the sources and I would recommend that,uh,you get on a lot of mailing lists and find out those kinds of information in Primus out of Hillsdale College,Rockford College.A lot of them have good sources that you can use,uh,in the classroom.Unfortunately that's what you'll have to do

**spk_0:** [21:45.23 - 21:47.93] one of these days.We're going to come out with Eagle Forum's reading list.

**spk_1:** [21:48.07 - 21:51.70] Bill's calling from Wheeler,Texas over KPDR.

**spk_0:** [21:51.84 - 21:53.99] Hello Bill,what is your question?Well,

**spk_7:** [21:54.11 - 21:59.99] my question is this Are you familiar with Frank E.Peretti's book Piercing the Darkness?

**spk_0:** [22:00.23 - 22:00.77] No,I'm not.

**spk_2:** [22:00.83 - 22:22.80] I'm,I'm familiar with it.Yes,in fact,I've interviewed him.Uh,Phyllis.Oh,go ahead.Very,very real,uh,story.Frank,uh,told me that his Piercing the Darkness is actually based on a case.In a classroom,uh,so it's a real story about the new age and what has happened in the classroom,uh,when they're trying to teach an agenda that is not necessarily the historic agenda of our country.You mean this

**spk_0:** [22:22.80 - 22:25.12] is an example of teaching new age in the classroom,

**spk_2:** [22:25.20 - 22:29.87] right?It's based,it's a novel and it's based on that and a very vivid novel.Did you

**spk_0:** [22:29.87 - 22:31.98] have a comment on that,Bill?Yes,I did.

**spk_7:** [22:32.23 - 23:15.52] Uh,during the book and the,the first book that came out with that,This Present Darkness.It's where the new age is coming against Christians in every,uh,realm,you know,in the government,in their,uh,civil rights and everything like that,but he puts a very,very strong emphasis on praying and fighting the battle in the spiritual realm,and that's where it's going to be won,and the Christians are going to have to get together and get in,uh,one spirit,one mind,and one accord and pray.That the leaders will do the right things so that this can be overcome and save those children that's in the public schools that are being taught all of this,uh,ungodliness.

**spk_0:** [23:15.65 - 23:42.50] Well,I do believe in praying,uh,to reform the schools,uh,but you also have to realize that there are other aspects.Uh,there is the community involvement aspect and there is the political aspect,and the National Education Association is a very political organization.They donate to candidates for office.They,they run school board elections.Uh,they are determined to keep their control,and personally I think we have to fight this on every level.

**spk_2:** [23:42.71 - 23:55.46] P Phyllis,I might add too that,uh,in the book of James it says that,uh,faith without works,and,and indeed this is a case in which prayer is in critical need,but so are your actions in the classroom.Thanks,

**spk_0:** [23:55.47 - 23:56.17] Bill,for calling and we have.

**spk_1:** [23:57.09 - 24:07.54] Lots of people out there waiting to talk to you,Donna,Phyllis,and we move out to our station in Pennsylvania.Here's Jane over WCHR for Phyllis Schlaffly.

**spk_0:** [24:07.64 - 24:10.09] Hello Jane,what is your question?Hi,I don't have

**spk_1:** [24:10.09 - 24:56.87] a question.I'd just like to let you know what's going on here in Pennsylvania.Um,my son is a 9th grader right now,but when I became a Christian when he was in 5th grade,I found out a lot of things that were going on that are not really right.Ah,his social studies books when,when he got into 7th grade,I go through all of his books.I make them bring them all home so I can flip through them,and they make things seem like a walk in the park when Hitler did what he did over in Germany,and,uh,the,the reading primers are not allowed home from 1st to 6th grade,and I found that out when I had asked for primers to come home because he used to sing in a tour group,and they said it has to be under contained classroom.Well,you have no idea what they're giving these children to read from 1st to 6th grade.Well,that's true.

**spk_0:** [24:57.81 - 25:02.93] Well,uh,I'm very happy that you're reading your textbooks and finding out so you can protect your child.

**spk_2:** [25:03.05 - 25:14.67] That's,that's absolutely important that every parent listening today takes the time and not skims.Let me tell you,don't skim those books.Sit down and ask one key question.What is the message?

**spk_1:** [25:15.07 - 25:44.11] We've had to pull out encyclopedias,old encyclopedias,and show him exactly where his textbooks are wrong in English class they're all new age,and I drive a school bus too,and uh I play either Christian music or classical music on the bus,and I drove a band one night and they said to me,Don't you have any new age music?Now that to me shows there's something going on within the schools when when the high schoolers know there's a difference between good Christian music and classical music and what they call new age.

**spk_0:** [25:44.29 - 25:47.69] Well,thank you Jane for calling.We're going to try to squeeze another call in.

**spk_1:** [25:47.89 - 25:52.34] Very good.It's Harold over KAGC on.College Station.

**spk_0:** [25:52.59 - 26:25.11] Hello Harold.What is your question?Well,I was wondering how that Oh,we really need you because of the way so many parents are treated when they raise questions about the schools,and sometimes the parents are retaliated against by the school through their children.And it's very important that people who don't have children are interested in this,how you can get involved.You can subscribe to our education reporter.You can start off with my book Child Abuse in the Classroom.You can get your friends to call in and listen,and,uh,then you can be informed.

**spk_2:** [26:25.37 - 26:42.20] Now,Phyllis,I would say that,uh,you're a taxpayer,and,uh,that's all you need to walk into those school board meetings,start attending those school board meetings,find out what's going on,find out who's making the decisions,and,uh,use just basic common.Values as your judgment of whether it's right or wrong and get others with you.Well,

**spk_0:** [26:42.40 - 27:15.46] believe me,we do need taxpayers and,uh,non-parents to work on the subject of education.After all,89% of the school children in America are in public schools today,so they will be the big majority of the world you live in and,uh,any children you may have in the future will live in.We need you now after our break,we're gonna come back to Donna Hearn and ask her to tell us about the censorship.and the lack of many ideas that were evident at this convention of social studies teachers that she recently attended.

**spk_1:** [27:15.59 - 27:20.31] Anne,what kind of calls have you been getting in the advisory center to date,Phyllis?Well,

**spk_0:** [27:20.40 - 27:24.57] I think the calls we've had today are good examples,and we get them every day,and we try to help,

**spk_1:** [27:24.67 - 28:02.39] and you do indeed help.Well,we're talking with Donna Hearn on P Phyllis-Schlafly Live.You know,Donna's so close to this issue.Social studies in the classroom.Incidentally,with the convention of the National Council of Social Studies right here in St.Louis,hosts a local program.As a matter of fact,it always draws a great response,and you've picked up a good guest today,Phyllis.Well,come on in.Let's hear from you.1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202 on the USA Radio Network,the program putting you at the forefront of education.We'll be back on Philly Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [30:06.44 - 30:27.37] Hello,and we're talking with Donna Hearn who a few weeks ago attended the national convention of the National Council of Social Studies.Uh,Donna,there were so many workshops and various sessions at this convention.Tell us,were they very open to different points of view,the points of view that we might present,or did they censor our views out?Well,

**spk_2:** [30:27.48 - 30:48.42] Phyllis,I think the obvious answer to that is that they had an agenda,and probably the easiest way to give a flavor of what their agenda was is just to read some of the topics of the workshops,bearing in mind that One of the first workshops on Friday dealt with censorship,and I can tell you a little bit about what they call censorship.

**spk_0:** [30:48.49 - 30:50.08] You in a mean they think we're censors.Well,

**spk_2:** [30:50.20 - 31:20.37] absolutely.As a matter of fact,uh,in that entire workshop,they only talked about those people like the fundamentalists,the right-wing extremists,Phyllis-Schlafly by name,uh,some of these people who are for creation instead of evolution.And of course they brought up a program that had caused a lot of stir some years ago called MACOS,MA,A Course of Study that had to do with the Netsilic Indians and even,

**spk_0:** [31:20.39 - 31:22.60] even Ronald Reagan spoke out against that.

**spk_2:** [31:22.72 - 31:57.59] But you see,that was their horror story because they had lost that program and so they proceeded to give an illustration of how one school district.Managed to keep the program and how they they told the audience was that what you did is you appoint a committee in the community and you put on it one Baptist preacher and the rest that you put on are people who are favorable to the program.And you have them come together and they look into the program and they discuss it and of course obviously the conclusion will be that it'll be one versus how many others that they have appointed and

**spk_0:** [31:57.59 - 32:02.42] of course they intimidate the Baptist preacher and they tell him that all these other people are the experts.Well,

**spk_2:** [32:02.47 - 32:25.20] that's correct,and they allow him to have a minority paper and a minority view,but of course then they come to the community and they say,well,you see,we heard all the Different viewpoints and it was a 12 to 1 or whatever the vote might be and the community is behind this program and let's proceed and of course they used an actual case study of the MCOs in Florida which

**spk_0:** [32:25.20 - 32:27.75] was just a horrendous program for

**spk_2:** [32:27.75 - 32:58.54] those who don't know what it was,uh,it promoted cannibalism,it promoted putting grandma out on the ice,euthanasia when she got too old.You just set her out on the ice and let her die,and uh,you ate the babies if there were too many of them and um.Uh,incest.I mean,it was just,just horrid.It was horrendous,and this was for 5th graders,and of course it was a federal grant.We're going back a few years,Phyllis,when we talk about this,but it was one of the pilot programs of the worldview that you see preeminent in what they're doing today.

**spk_0:** [32:58.58 - 33:04.62] And at this convention you went to a couple of weeks ago,they were still defending it.Oh yes,and then proud of the school that was able to keep it in.

**spk_2:** [33:04.78 - 33:32.19] Yes,as a matter of fact,very proud of it,and Uh,when they mentioned the word MCOs,there was this chuckle in the room saying,oh yes,we remember that battle,and so you had seasoned people in there.So I think what the implementation was,Phyllis,is that this,uh,group of people who are dealing with these issues,who are in the leadership positions,and these were leadership people,these were not just teachers in this one particular workshop,they know where they're headed.

**spk_0:** [33:32.27 - 33:42.83] Well,talking about censorship,uh,just a word or two on what they censor.Out of their view of the world or their workshops or their textbooks or teachings on social studies.

**spk_2:** [33:43.17 - 33:53.72] Well,I just read the catalog.They have one agenda.We didn't see anything that was strong national defense,nothing there at all that dealt with that.How about

**spk_0:** [33:53.72 - 33:54.43] patriotism?

**spk_2:** [33:54.92 - 34:23.08] Nothing with patriotism.In fact,in the entire exhibit area,and there had to be over 600 exhibits because if they,they went by numbers and,and I think it got up to about 600.There was only one exhibit,Phyllis,that I could say had some semblance of sanity,and that was an exhibit having to do with nuclear energy and why nuclear power was a good resource to have,and You know,that was probably other

**spk_0:** [34:23.08 - 34:28.93] than that it was other than that against any type of developing cheap energy or having national defense.

**spk_2:** [34:29.00 - 34:57.07] Oh yeah,and in fact,you know,environment was very much an issue here that we must protect the environment.We had an awful lot of information on the US and the USSR.In fact,one of the workshops was choices for the 20.First century,uh,there was a pass out on a trip to,uh,the Soviet Union in April that you could go on and,and to find out just how wonderful it is and then,and then even the textbooks,uh,you know,we're,we're certainly developing textbooks together,

**spk_0:** [34:57.08 - 35:04.57] uh,and at the same time they don't know anything about the United States.Well,let's go back to,uh.A couple of calls.Uh,Bruce,here's Anne

**spk_1:** [35:04.57 - 35:06.53] in Roanoke Rapids,North Carolina.

**spk_0:** [35:06.61 - 37:12.71] Hello,Anne.What is your question or comment today?Well,I heard Donna talk about the social studies.Uh,people have a special agenda,and I wanted to speak to that just a moment as well as the censorship issue.I have a newsletter on the social studies professional of May and June 1985 and the listening audience may be interested in one of these paragraphs in this letter.The social studies staff themselves,the professionals actually have said here,those of us committed to the purposes of social education have failed to convince the public that these purposes are legitimate and they're talking about their whole agenda or they're even noble.Worse yet,too many of us have attempted to hide what we're doing in school.and have discouraged parents from learning the truth.Well,that is all the truth,isn't it?Yeah,I think they have actually put their finger in this article on exactly what they are doing to censor and to keep us from knowing what they're doing.Also,Donna was mentioning the special agenda,the lack of patriotism and the feminist agenda and all these things that they are promoting.Here is a paragraph from the Social Science Education Consortium newsletter of November 1974,and here's the quote.The fundamental purpose is to help students to perceive themselves and act not as separate egos but as part of a larger interrelated whole.And race,the world,the cosmos,and some of the techniques which can be used include transcendental meditation,self hypnosis,dream analysis,and mind expanding drugs.Well,thank you very much,Anne.It sounds like they're trying to train them to accept the new age ideology and be global citizens.A movement that is the agenda of the social studies and

**spk_2:** [37:12.71 - 37:48.74] I might jump in and relate what you're saying,bring it up to date to the November conference,and show that one of the workshops they had was called Alternate Methods to Assess Students' Knowledge,Skills,and Attitudes Related to International Education,and the little blurb in it says evaluation staff from the California International Studies Projects will discuss alternate methods of assessing students' perceptions of themselves in relation to the world.These innovative,uh,measures go beyond conventional tests by offering insight into the processes of attitude formation,critical thinking,and knowledge acquisition.Uh,

**spk_0:** [37:49.04 - 37:54.74] and I,I wish we could talk to you more,but we've got so many calls waiting.I think we'll try to squeeze one more in before the break,

**spk_1:** [37:54.82 - 37:57.89] like Leonard standing by in Philadelphia over WCHR.

**spk_0:** [37:58.50 - 38:09.38] Hello Leonard,what is your question or comment?Was,was at the convention to the Council on Foreign Relations,the Trilateral Commission.And the skull and bones,

**spk_3:** [38:09.70 - 38:14.07] which have been very active in this one world government and in which President Bush has been a member.

**spk_2:** [38:14.57 - 38:53.47] Um,actually I saw nothing about the Council on Foreign Relations in print.Now that doesn't mean that,ah,there wasn't the influence there.They did have an,ah,as I mentioned earlier,they had all kinds of,ah,major workshops as well as general sessions,and one of the general sessions that they had,which was On Monday,uh,it was called A View from Washington History in the Making,and on the panel was David Broder of The Washington Post,William Raspberry of The Washington Post,uh,Noel Epstein of the Washington Post National Weekly Edition,and Judy Mann from The Washington Post.Now,ah,that's interesting.I think you've got a lot of variations of view on that one.

**spk_0:** [38:53.76 - 39:04.71] They're all the same view,and they're all proposing a global citizenship and interdependence.Uh,which translated usually means the United States should send our money over to other countries.Right.

**spk_1:** [39:05.47 - 39:23.85] Well,if you want to try and come in here,I promise you we'll try and squeeze you in at 1-800-736-3202.Social studies or lack thereof in the classrooms.That's what we're addressing today live via satellites on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_3:** [39:30.00 - 40:28.80] A national panel reported that 25% of 17-year-olds are functional illiterates.Another 40% are marginal illiterates.That means nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science.What have they been doing all those years in public schools?Sex education,death education,new age meditation,and other non-academic psychological activities.This can be stopped.US law gives you,the parents,primary control over your children's education.Find out about your rights.Read the Education Reporter.It's a monthly newspaper from Eagle-Forum.The education reporter keeps you informed about offensive school curricula and about victories won by parents who assert their rights.Write for a free sample of the education reporter.The address Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.

**spk_1:** [40:33.20 - 40:37.14] From the north to the south we're standing proud from

**spk_0:** [40:37.78 - 40:37.81] the field.

**spk_1:** [40:38.77 - 41:35.35] Like trees shut the.Our Constitution is still standing by.it.Kept us strong.It's made our people.I On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live right back to the telephone calls high atop Mount Bullion.Here's KCIV with Gene.

**spk_0:** [41:35.56 - 41:50.66] Hello Gene,what is your question?Well,I basically have a comment.What I have noticed throughout all of the curriculum besides just geography is that it's no longer teaching anymore.It's indoctrination.Yes.Indeed,Don,you,uh,Donna,you can,yes,

**spk_2:** [41:51.26 - 42:46.01] as a matter of fact,um,you know,I,we were just mentioning that,uh,we were talking about geography and how little we saw of the old fashioned kind of geography.Even the geography that they discussed in this,uh,conference has a political agenda.Not only does it have a political agenda,they're even talking about changing the maps.One of the,uh,programs here says that,uh,They would use geography,passport to the nation and the world,says in a presentation of materials and discussion of strategies and outcomes,methods for expanding the role of geography in educating children to be citizens of the world,um,and it's,and it has to do with the National Geographic Society as well as they're even changing the maps that they're using because.They say they've the maps we've used have had a political,uh,drawing,and so now there's now this new Peter's map,Phyllis,that shows the third world countries larger than what they've been.Oh,

**spk_0:** [42:46.17 - 42:52.81] that's a politicizing geography.Uh,thank you very much for calling,Jeane,and we move on to a great radio

**spk_1:** [42:52.81 - 42:55.37] station,K Lights in Hawaii.Here's Cecilia.

**spk_0:** [42:55.49 - 44:03.52] Hello,Cecilia.Good morning.What is your question?I want to commend you on having such an important subject be brought up on your program and having,uh,parents be able to call in and comment.Uh,here in Hawaii,December 7th is a,is a very memorable day,um,as you all know,but in my son's school,which is a junior high school,without the parents' knowledge,they had Trans Roll Day where the boys were to dress like women and girls like men,and I just on Pearl Harbor Day.And this was on Pearl on Pearl Harbor Day.Or did that have anything to do with anything,or was this some oddball idea of some teacher?Evidently.I'm going to look into it on Monday because when I came home from work Friday night,I found my son wearing my necklace.He was dressed as a,like he usually does,but he had my necklace on and he explained to me why,and he thought it was just a great idea.These children are being bombarded with so much of the new age.Thinking and I think it,it's time,you know,if not already passed that parents do get involved.Celia,

**spk_2:** [44:03.58 - 44:24.84] I commend you for being concerned,and again I think Phyllis and I would both,uh,tell all of our parents listening today that you really need to know what your children are doing in that classroom,the materials.They don't bring home as well as those that they do,and,uh,in many cases you may have to get the child out and put them in a either home school or put them in a private Christian school.

**spk_1:** [44:25.14 - 44:34.54] And will you do us a favor?You said you're going to contact the school on Monday.Will you at least call our advisory center and even call this toll-free number and let us know how that goes.

**spk_0:** [44:35.35 - 44:36.82] Thank you,thank you for calling,Cecilia.

**spk_1:** [44:36.98 - 44:40.12] And we move on to Flemington,New Jersey.Here's Gertrude.

**spk_0:** [44:40.62 - 44:50.04] Hello,Gertrude,what is your question?Um,mine is a comment,uh,and question,and my comment is,um,

**spk_1:** [44:50.41 - 44:50.89] first of

**spk_0:** [44:50.89 - 44:52.42] all,I'm sure

**spk_1:** [44:52.42 - 44:55.10] most of the people listening are Christians,

**spk_0:** [44:55.65 - 45:50.53] and I have gone to a number of different Christian churches,uh,Pentecostal,and,you know,charisma,yeah,charismatic and whatnot,charismatic,and,um.And the,uh,Pentecostal Church is an old fashioned Pentecostal church,and it taught us well,but,um,one thing that I wasn't in agreement with is the keeping aside from the things that were going on in the world,not voting,etc.Um,therefore we lost our vote.We lost our privilege to,um,try to set things straight.Um,I did.Well,I do believe,Gertrude,that if Christians don't exercise their right to vote,to participate,to supervise what's going on in the schools,then they're going to be governed by the laws of other people who don't agree.With you,

**spk_2:** [45:52.36 - 46:12.66] Gertrude,I'd jump in too and say that,uh,in the Bible it says to render under Caesar and,uh,yeah,and,and interestingly enough,the United States system,the things that are Caesar's is a participatory democracy,which means that you've got to be part of it.So,uh,we would both encourage you to certainly encourage.Others to get involved.Well,

**spk_0:** [46:12.85 - 46:20.78] this is the reason I'm making that comment today.Well,we appreciate your call,Gertrude.We have so many calls we need to move on to the next one.Spokane,

**spk_1:** [46:20.85 - 46:23.93] and here's Ronald on KUDY.Hello,

**spk_0:** [46:24.01 - 46:24.89] Ronald.Yes,

**spk_8:** [46:24.97 - 46:37.85] I have a,uh,uh,question and then a comment.Uh,could we consider what these teachers,uh,That are basically new age and are trying to put this new philosophy onto our children,could we consider that proselytizing?

**spk_0:** [46:38.63 - 46:51.49] Uh,yes,you could consider that.You could also consider it a violation of your First Amendment rights because it's bringing religion in the classroom.Uh,but frequently it's,uh,not the teachers who are doing this,but the materials that are put in their hands.

**spk_2:** [46:51.61 - 47:07.62] In many cases,Phyllis,it is the teachers are,uh,many of them are busy,and,uh,they,they sell them the new age stuff because of the stress and the discipline,and they say these are ways that you can make your children,uh,better learn.Learners and and a good teacher wants to have a better learner and Lois

**spk_1:** [47:07.62 - 47:10.15] is listening in St.Louis over KSIV.

**spk_0:** [47:10.34 - 47:23.80] Hello Lois,what is your question,Phyllis?Uh,there was a meeting here in St.Louis conducted at Fontbonne College put on,I think,by an organization called the Network,and they were

**spk_6:** [47:23.81 - 47:26.59] teaching teachers how to teach critical thinking.

**spk_0:** [47:27.34 - 48:09.39] Can you tell me who is the best expert in the country who's researched,uh,I heard Donna mention the term,uh,critical thinking.Critical thinking is a very trendy subject in the schools.Uh,I would ask the question,what are they going to be thinking about?Uh,usually it's part of a,a non-directive type of counseling in which it is teaching children situation ethics that any decision they make is OK,and I would say that Doctor Bill Colson has the best material on that and we have.Printed his material in our education reporter.Uh,well,this subject,Donna,certainly has stimulated a lot of calls.It was quite something that you went to that,uh,convention and right,

**spk_2:** [48:09.51 - 48:18.97] right,and Phyllis,we haven't even gotten through,uh,just a smidgen of all of the,uh,the menu that they offered for those who wanted to go and see what,uh,what was ahead.Um,

**spk_0:** [48:19.43 - 48:26.90] we'll have to have you back soon again,Donna Hearn.In order to talk more about social studies courses and what's going on in those classes in the school.

**spk_1:** [48:27.10 - 48:45.00] Oh,she's got a pile of information.In fact,it's hitting the ceiling,and it's been a good get-together.Thank you,Donna Hearn.On the USA Radio Network.We'll be expecting your closing commentary,Phyllis,on the program,putting you at the forefront of what's really happening in the public schools.This is P Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_9:** [48:47.55 - 49:44.24] Too many children have been cheated out of the education they deserve.Did you know that nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science?That's a problem we can no longer afford to ignore.Educational excellence in the public school starts with respect for the rights of students,parents,and taxpayers.But what are they?Every student has the right to be taught to read the English language in the first grade.Every student has the right to family privacy,the right to his religious faith and beliefs,the right to share information with his parents.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy from Eagle-Forum.Learn more about the rights you and your children should expect.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy by writing Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_0:** [50:44.53 - 51:22.30] Today we've been discussing social studies courses in the schools,and it brought so many calls that we're going to have to do this program soon again.We hope we can have Donna Hearn back,who is,uh,served on several national commissions on this subject,and,uh,we hope she'll rejoin us.She has told us that social studies courses are pursuing their own agenda of teaching global citizenship,interdependence,population control,and a de-emphasis on patriotism instead of the traditional subjects like history and geography.Uh,next week we're going to talk about how Christmas is censored out of the public schools,so get your calls ready and we'll talk to you next week.
