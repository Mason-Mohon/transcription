**spk_0:** [00:01.52 - 00:11.40] Christian religion is barred from being taught in the public schools.Practices of new age religions are frequently taught.Stay tuned and we'll talk about it.

**spk_1:** [00:11.68 - 00:56.34] That's the voice of one of America's most admired and respected women.For the next hour you'll hear the informed pro-family perspective of P Phyllis-Schlafly.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we'll be looking forward to hearing from you today as we discuss the new age movement in the public schools and your rights as a.Parents.Our new affiliate this week is KOFC Sayetteville,Arkansas,and our toll-free number from anywhere in America is 1-800-736-3202.Jot that number down because you may have a question or comment on this controversial matter.1-800-736-3202.I'm Bruce Hayes,and now to introduce today's program,here's Phyllis.

**spk_0:** [00:56.63 - 03:52.74] Recently,I went into a big commercial bookstore in New York City.There I was surprised to find a whole big rack called New Age.It had all sorts of books about reincarnation and out of body experiences.There were books by movie stars.Uh,there were all sorts of books.Uh,I did not see a rack of Christian books,but New Age was apparently very popular,and I had the same experience in a bookstore in Washington DC.I note that Shirley MacLaine was telling all about New Age on the Johnny Carson show.And then I read in the Wall Street Journal about businesses putting in management courses for consciousness raising among their employees which use a lot of new age techniques.This has become highly controversial.Now in the great big free United States of America,uh,people have the right to believe in all these things if they want to,uh,the right to publish and buy books and the right to attend new age courses,but when it comes to what goes on in the public school classroom,that is another matter because we're dealing with minor children and a captive audience.I first learned about a new age in the classroom when we began to get calls at our Eagle-Forum Parents Advisory Center about children being taught in the classroom that there's a wise man living inside them uh with whom they should consult when they had problems.The children were not told to consult with their parents or with their clergymen,but with this mythical person who lives inside of them.Uh,some children were told to consult with a wise rabbit who had all the answers to the questions.Uh,some were told to lie down on the floor and they would be wafted up to the clouds or to a grassy knoll somewhere where they would find the answers to their problems.We found that some children were being given classes in meditation.Uh,now you know if you've kept up with the schools that we're not permitted to have prayer and Bible reading in the public schools,we're not even permitted to have silent prayer.But meditation,uh,that is one of the practices of these Eastern mystical religions,and we do indeed find that some of those things are coming into the schools.If you've had experiences like this,uh,I hope you'll call us on our toll-free number 800-736-3202.We'd like to hear from you.Uh,they are very odd courses and parents are very upset.They discover this because it seems to interfere with their religious beliefs and practices,and we're at

**spk_1:** [03:52.74 - 04:11.93] 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202 across America.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live on the USA Radio Network.Ready for our first phone call?Yes,have we got a call?We sure do.Let's go to Gene in Lynnville,Indiana.Hello,

**spk_0:** [04:11.94 - 04:20.61] hello,Gene.Hello.Have you had experience with some of these new age practices in the public school classroom?

**spk_2:** [04:20.81 - 04:23.39] Oh yes,we've had lots of experience with it.

**spk_0:** [04:24.54 - 04:27.44] Tell us something about it.What did they call it?What was the course called?

**spk_2:** [04:27.82 - 04:34.50] Well,it wasn't a course for the children.It was a course for the teachers.The course was called Tactics for Thinking.

**spk_0:** [04:34.82 - 04:37.02] Well,we're certainly in favor of thinking,aren't we?

**spk_2:** [04:37.22 - 04:41.54] Oh yes,but not in an altered state of consciousness,altered state

**spk_0:** [04:41.54 - 04:42.62] of consciousness.

**spk_2:** [04:43.29 - 05:13.76] Now they didn't tell the teachers they were doing that.They just took the teachers for um.Uh,training seminar,cause all of our teachers were either going to be retrained or retired.And they were big on this because we are a model school and a pilot school for Indiana.So the thing that made it easier for us.was that we had so many programs and they had them in.We could go and find out what they were.

**spk_0:** [05:14.90 - 05:20.68] So you,uh,looked at some of the materials and the books that were used in this teacher training program.

**spk_2:** [05:20.78 - 05:20.79] Yes.

**spk_0:** [05:21.74 - 05:22.86] And what did you find out?

**spk_2:** [05:23.14 - 05:34.34] Well,and tactics for thinking,this was a manual written by Robert J.Marzano,and he works for the Midcontinent Regional Educational Laboratory.

**spk_0:** [05:34.66 - 05:36.36] Well,that means it's federally funded.

**spk_2:** [05:37.36 - 05:45.05] Yes,and we even found the contract numbers and the document resume to prove that all of his research was done with federal money.

**spk_0:** [05:45.37 - 05:59.61] Well,hadn't they ever heard about the protection of pupil Rights Amendment that is supposed to say that with federally funded.Materials you can't engage in this type of psychological treatment without prior written parental consent.

**spk_2:** [06:00.00 - 06:24.24] They're not worried about that.They,they aren't threatened in the least.In fact,one of the superintendents,what we have here is two small districts in the same county,and one of the superintendents was.Far more progressive and more experienced than the other,and he dared us to do anything about it.Now some of the parents have filed a complaint with the Department of Education,but they basically are doing nothing.

**spk_0:** [06:25.68 - 06:32.22] Well,uh,tell us some of the practices that were taught to the teachers in this tactics for thinking course.

**spk_2:** [06:32.99 - 06:52.18] The 1st 6 chapters or units were to do with the altered state of consciousness.In chapter 1,they taught them to focus,um,relax by a breathing technique and clear their mind.Um,after that,then they went into,well,

**spk_0:** [06:52.31 - 06:57.24] no,you,you know,to a lot of people,it's fine to be relaxed and have your mind cleared,isn't it?

**spk_2:** [06:57.63 - 07:43.26] Yes,it is,and,and there's nothing wrong with relaxation,but what we found that now most anytime they're talking about relaxation in school,they are talking about preparing the children for a hypnotic trance.And when you study hypnosis,you find that the more you study it,And the more you,I mean,the more you practice it,the deeper the trance and the easier to get into the trance.So one of,um,the references in Marzano's book said that uh there were two kinds of attention,voluntary and involuntary,and the involuntary is the trance-like state.And he said if you have the two competing in a child's Um,the involuntary state will overcome the other.

**spk_0:** [07:43.50 - 07:57.21] Well,I don't think most parents would agree in the least to have their children put in a hypnotic trance in the public school classroom.Are you really saying that these were hypnotic practices that were being taught to the teachers?

**spk_2:** [07:57.46 - 08:24.25] Yes,the teachers did not know this.We were taking the training.Uh,one of the teachers even helped us in the research of the program,and she said in the training,all she could think was this sure is dumb,but there were doctors sitting there,and she felt as though they were much smarter than she,so she wasn't going to question what was done.And,you know,even,uh,if it wasn't just sheer nonsense.It would still be a waste of time.

**spk_0:** [08:24.53 - 08:35.93] Well,is it one of these things where they invoke the experts and make you think like you're,you're pretty stupid if you don't accept the courses that are put forth by the so-called experts?

**spk_2:** [08:36.09 - 08:41.33] Yes.That's always a technique that they use.The parents are supposed to be dumb to read,I think.

**spk_0:** [08:41.98 - 09:07.45] Give us some of the the jargon that these people use.Uh,they're,they're words that we don't customarily associate with the public school classroom like reading.Writing and arithmetic in these new age techniques,do they talk about things like meditation,uh,concentration,focusing,um,guided imagery,visualization?Do they use all words like that?Yes,

**spk_2:** [09:09.44 - 09:31.84] they use all of those words and in one of the books that we did for research,we found that Beverly Gallien had stated to distinguish.Uh,between religious meditation and what we wanted our children to do in school that they should call it visualization or focusing,centering,something like that,not to alert the conservative parents.

**spk_0:** [09:32.31 - 09:38.11] Is this the course that talked about deep processing?Yes,and tell us what that means.

**spk_2:** [09:38.31 - 09:43.17] Well,deep processing was nothing but to get them into the out of body experience

**spk_0:** [09:43.31 - 09:47.73] and tell us what an out of body experience is.I don't think I've ever had one.

**spk_2:** [09:48.20 - 10:04.80] I think most of us haven't had one,but a lot of people who get into it say that it's better than drugs as far as getting on a high because if you'd rather not be here today,you just,uh,go into a deep trance and take a trip to Florida and come back when you feel rested and relaxed.

**spk_0:** [10:05.12 - 10:15.88] Well,do you think this is the reason why a lot of young people,especially if they watch a lot of television,simply have a hard time distinguishing between fantasy and reality?

**spk_2:** [10:16.84 - 10:37.92] Yes,and in the study that we've done,we've found that children who do sit in front of the TV and you can't get their attention are being set up to train their minds to alter their brain waves,and it's much easier for them to go into the trance.So when they have these children in the classroom,it's easy for the teacher to do this.

**spk_0:** [10:38.16 - 11:10.29] Well,tell me,is this tactics for Thinking course the one where children are taught such things as Pretend to be a snowflake or um it it's a very sensual experience isn't it?In other words they're they're supposed to feel everything feel feel uh the fur of the like a beaver would feel or feel the cool moist.Ocean air or or feel like a snowflake would feel as it floats down from the sky,is that the kind of thing?

**spk_2:** [11:10.66 - 11:32.60] Yes,and that's what we're seeing,you know,you were talking about differences in terminologies we,we hear more all about the effective learning.And this is nothing but emotional,and when they're talking about right brain,left brain,it condemns logical thinking and says that we should only think with our hearts and not our head anymore.

**spk_0:** [11:32.86 - 11:37.42] Well,if the children are spending time on this,what's happening to reading,writing,and arithmetic?

**spk_2:** [11:37.77 - 11:41.50] They really aren't interested in that.What they're interested in is changing their values.

**spk_0:** [11:41.70 - 11:44.76] Well,now tell me,what did you do?Did you get rid of the cars?

**spk_2:** [11:45.61 - 11:57.76] Yes,we did.In one of the two school districts here we had to replace 2 school board members and we had the assistant superintendent resign and the superintendent resign over this

**spk_0:** [11:57.76 - 12:05.73] course,was this the issue?Yeah But you did you get the tactics for thinking program out of your school after we

**spk_2:** [12:05.73 - 12:07.09] got rid of.

**spk_0:** [12:08.04 - 12:26.52] You got rid of the superintendent and and changed the school board,then you got rid of the objectionable program,but I assume that this program is going to pop up elsewhere around the country since it was federally funded.The federal taxpayers paid to develop it at one of these so-called education laboratories they have.

**spk_2:** [12:27.11 - 12:50.51] Well,our Indiana Department of Education is pushing that,and of course,like I said,we are a model and a pilot school,so we were being promoted throughout the state that other schools should look at us to see what we were doing.And in addition to that,um,the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development,who publishes the book is promoting this not only nationwide but internationally.

**spk_0:** [12:50.83 - 13:14.59] Well,I heard that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has a regulation that prohibits.Employers from subjecting their employees uh to this type of of new age training programs if it's offensive for adults who are uh grown up and on the job somewhere um how do you feel about it being used on minor children.

**spk_2:** [13:15.34 - 14:04.40] Well,you know,in the classroom they're tactics.They can't get away from it.And in fact the school district beside us put out a statement saying that no parent could have their children taken from a class where tactics for thinking was used and that,um,I worry about this,uh,Senate joint resolution that,uh,Senator Pell from Rhode Island has putting him through this 135 where he wants to define techniques that will cause people to reach their highest potential in body,mind and spirit,and Knowing that he is a man who's deep into this new age and the altered states of consciousness,I think if our,uh,senators begin defining this technique for us,then maybe we will even lose,uh,this for the business people,and we won't stand a chance of having a,a fight against it in school or the business.

**spk_0:** [14:04.78 - 14:12.97] One more quick question was this used and planned to be used as a special course or was it permeating all the different subjects?

**spk_2:** [14:13.53 - 14:22.57] It was to be used periodically throughout the day in any subject,and it was to be used kindergarten through the 12th grade.Well,

**spk_0:** [14:22.67 - 14:28.25] thank you very much,Gene,for alerting us to this.We appreciate your call and I'm glad you got rid of it.Thank you.

**spk_1:** [14:28.82 - 14:47.83] Phyllis,uh,just a moment ago I heard you talk about the Students' Bill of Rights.Well,Eagle-Forum definitely has a copy of that in a nice colorful packet.It's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.If you'd like to write and get a copy of that,uh,you might want to pass it along to,uh,your son or daughter.

**spk_0:** [19:41.48 - 19:44.51] Do you have a comment on the new age techniques?

**spk_5:** [19:44.84 - 20:21.90] There's several comments I'd like to make.Um,one being that,uh,the Lord Jesus saved me in 1966 after I had been involved in this sort of thing for a year and a half.At that time,they didn't call it new age.What do they call it?Well,they just called it occult or metaphysics,parapsychology.They would try to disguise it in scientific terms.And,uh,I became instantly aware after my conversion that and began to read the scriptures that uh new age occultism is really no different than black magic and Satanism.It's all the same thing under different labels.

**spk_0:** [20:22.42 - 20:25.48] They have a variety of different practices and techniques.

**spk_5:** [20:25.98 - 20:26.36] Yes,they do.

**spk_0:** [20:26.89 - 20:27.94] You want to mention a couple.

**spk_5:** [20:29.03 - 20:42.91] Well,automatic handwriting,astrology,they're some of the more common ones.And then I heard you earlier on the program talking about out of body experiences.I never got into that,but I thank God he rescued me before I got that deep into it.

**spk_0:** [20:43.59 - 21:02.35] Well,it definitely has religious overtones,and while adults can do whatever they want,I guess,in this free country,when it comes into the public school classroom,we have a really serious offense against the First Amendment rights of parents and their children.Don't you think?Is that you,would you agree with that?

**spk_5:** [21:02.47 - 21:42.53] That's exactly so.I was aware not too long ago of a A few parents in Colorado who are being sued by a teacher because they complained to the the school board about the witchcraft they were teaching their children in the schools,and I was instantly aware of the fact that you have a First Amendment right to redress the government,so the teacher had no right to sue these people.She also claimed that it really wasn't witchcraft,but I wrote to their lawyer,told them that when I was in that stuff,it really was witchcraft.And he could check it out in any Hill cult library,which he did,and he wrote me back thanking me for the information because it won the case for these people.

**spk_0:** [21:43.03 - 22:07.21] Well,thank you for telling us about that.Uh,there are two points of view.One point of view is that the school can do whatever it wants to with your children,and if you don't like it,you can take your child out and put him in a private school.Of course you can do that,but we believe.That children in the public school have rights that have to be respected by the school,and one of them is their First Amendment right to respect for their religion.

**spk_5:** [22:07.53 - 22:20.50] That's right,and I think that if an atheist can take all mention of Jesus Christ out of the schools,then It's hypocrisy to promote Hinduism and Nazism and communism and humanism and all these other religions in the school,

**spk_0:** [22:20.98 - 22:37.50] and we do find that some of these stress courses which go into the yoga and the meditation are leading the children into the eastern mystical religions in violation of their own reading of separation of church and state.

**spk_1:** [22:38.39 - 23:04.88] Our new affiliate.Week is KOFC Fayetteville,Arkansas,and across America.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.A couple open lines we had to add a couple lines since last week.We were just swamped with phone calls last week on your debut broadcast across America.Let's go to 1-800-736-3202 and we visit John in Oklahoma City over at KQCV.

**spk_0:** [23:05.42 - 27:04.40] Hi John.hello John.Have you had experience with this?Well,I'm concerned about the new age religion.Well,do you find it anywhere connected with the schools?Oh yes.Well,tell us about it.I live near Oklahoma City,and they recently had a program in the school for elementary age children.That was voted out by the school board because of the new age influence in it.Of course,quite a controversy about it.Did the parents organize and complain?Yes,they did.Tell us how,how it worked out.Did they?Well,they had to go to a board meeting and of course they had a number of arguments with various other parents and various other teachers about it.Well,tell us precisely what,what the parents were complaining about.You know,new age doesn't always mean something to everybody who they haven't experienced it.So what were the particular things they were complaining about?Well,one of the parents who objected to it wrote a letter to the editor in the newspaper.And I could quote you that one pretty well to let you know specifically.All right,what did he say?Well,it says elementary school children as well as older students are being indoctrinated into the occult world of visualization and guided imagery.This teaching of how to arrive at an altered state of consciousness comes from ancient shamanism,otherwise known as witchcraft or sorcery.And I could read more,but well,it seems to me that we send children to school to pay attention and learn the basics.Can you imagine why anybody would want to take them into an altered state of consciousness in the public school classroom?Well,of course the argument on the other side was they were building up their self-esteem.Well,I wouldn't you rather have self-esteem and the way you are rather than in some,uh,uh,fantasy land where you're not even a real person?You might be a snowflake.Well,I think it's better to get your self-esteem from learning to read and write,do arithmetic.Uh,this other stuff is just a distraction.Well,it is,uh,it is a distraction,and I do worry when these children go home and watch television and they see,uh,they see things that,um,uh,see,see people killed and then they don't believe they're really dead.Uh,they,they have a hard time distinguishing between fantasy and reality.I,uh,I have a doctor's son who worked in the emergency ward and,and when people would come in with gunshot wounds they would say things like,well,I didn't know it would really do that.They,they have a hard time relating to reality and um what's out there and what's real when they've had these periods when they're walking through a meadow and pretending they're floating through the air and experiencing these altered states of consciousness.Let me give you a more specific example.Back in January of '88,we had a 13 year old boy burned up by his twin sister.Because she wanted him to come back to a better life in reincarnation.Oh,that's very sad about that.Uh,that's very sad,but apparently this belief in reincarnation is very widespread.Um,and people,um,I think it may have,uh,quite an effect on these young people's suicide where they really believe they're going to come back in another life and have it better than they have it today,especially if they're fighting with their parents at the present time.They think they'll come back and be somebody better.They might even think they'll come back and be an animal or uh some other type of person.It's very sad if when this sort of thing is taught in the schools.

**spk_1:** [27:04.99 - 27:09.65] Can I jump in here for just a second?How early are children being taught this?

**spk_0:** [27:10.65 - 28:36.49] Well,I,we find in our parents advisory center that some of these stress and meditation courses are used in kindergarten and first grade,and sometimes it's sold as children need to be relieved of their stress.And um they have them lie down on the floor.That's another one of these techniques.Phyllis in Putnam City it was as young as the 2nd grade because one parent took her 2nd grade child out of grade school.Did they find out who was financing these courses?Do you know if any of it was the name of the program?Yes,what was the name of the program?Pum Pumpsy was the name of the program.Is that P U M S E Y,right?Pumpsey the dragon.Pumpsy the dragon.Did they slay the dragon or did the dragon slay them that much about it.OK,well,did anybody find out whether it was federally funded and therefore subject to the Protection of people Rights Amendment?One of the objections by the parents was that it was partly federally funded and they objected to it because of the federal regulation giving parental control over that.Well,I would hope that the parents would make a proper complaint to the US Department of Education.If anyone needs advice or the forms to make that kind of complaint,uh,we'll be happy to supply them from our Parents Advisory Center.

**spk_1:** [28:37.25 - 28:39.33] And thank you for the telephone call.

**spk_0:** [31:11.45 - 31:55.41] the religion editor of the Los Angeles Times,Rush Chandler,has said that the New Age movement has touched nearly every person in this country,including Christians.He describes some of the strange concepts of new age,the concept that the cosmos is pure.Differentiated universal energy and humans are an extension of that oneness,the concept that there are no absolute truths,that Jesus is only one of many enlightened masters,and that there is no such thing as sin.Humans have problems only because they have forgotten they have infinite potential.So these are some of the concepts we've been talking about today and we'd like to hear from another caller.

**spk_1:** [31:55.57 - 32:13.97] And we're at 1-800-736-3202 across America over the USA Radio Network,Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we're broadcasting from the facilities of KSIV in St.Louis,and we do have a call from that area.It's Gene.Hi,you're on the air with Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [32:14.89 - 32:21.74] Hello Jeane.Phyllis.Yes,hello Jean.This is Debbie.Oh,this is Debbie.All right,Debbie,

**spk_1:** [32:21.86 - 32:23.74] Debbie,uh,Debbie from Saint Charles.

**spk_0:** [32:24.38 - 32:26.10] All right,Debbie,do you have a

**spk_6:** [32:26.10 - 33:32.86] comment?Thank you.I'd like to say first of all,um,praise the Lord for people like you who just really stand up and let their voice be heard.And secondly,I'd like to say I was involved with New Age and the occult for many years and got into it basically.Um,I was a person that was searching for deeper answers,and I think what we need to take a look at is what is lacking in,in Christianity that causes people to look in other areas and number 1,these people are deceived.Uh,number 2,I think basically it's an ignorance of what the Bible is all about.So it's what we need to look at is how we can help these people.Who are deceived and I think we need to take a really good look at what's going on.I think there's a spiritual sense to all this and right now the things that are going on in our school,it's been over a period of years,this has been set up.It started with evolution.It just really opened the doors for new age to just come in and just completely move everything aside.And

**spk_0:** [33:33.89 - 33:51.07] well I think you're talking about it having a spiritual sense shows why many people,Christians particularly,believe that the use of new age concepts and practices in the public school classroom is a direct attack on the First Amendment rights of those who don't believe.In it.

**spk_6:** [33:51.20 - 34:08.41] That's exactly right,and I think,you know,it's sad but true.Satan is targeting our children,and you see it has to do with a lot of breakdowns in the families.Now if there is no communication within that family and if God isn't present there,then guess who is.

**spk_0:** [34:08.70 - 34:34.70] Well,I,I think you're probably true,uh,right with all that,uh,but what we're particularly concerned with here is not,uh,trying to,uh,set the family straight because the families have the responsibility for their own children.Uh,but it is,uh,making sure that these concepts are not taught in the public school classroom.So thanks a lot,Debbie,for your call.We appreciate it.And now

**spk_1:** [34:34.70 - 34:39.18] Gene in St.Louis over KSIV.Hi,you're on the air with Phyllis.Gene,

**spk_2:** [34:39.31 - 34:41.41] hello.Hi.Oh hi.

**spk_7:** [34:41.67 - 37:19.93] Uh,listen,what I found out was that the bill,they,that Senate Joint Bill 135.has been sent.To the Senate without hearings.Pell's office reported on 5/26 that the bill was exempt from public hearings because Senator Hatch and Kennedy agreed,and it went for the full Senate vote,would have passed unanimously,but Senator Coats from Indiana put a hold on the bill,and it's scheduled to go through as soon as possible.Uh,we need to call our senators at the state Capitol and ask them to vote no on SJR 125.Uh,the phone number they gave me was 202-224-3121.The short title of the bill is the National Commission on Human Resource Development Act.And,uh,it says that,uh,one,it's a normal aspiration of all.Citizens to more fully achieve their potential in body,mind,and spirit.Further down,it says it is a shared responsibility of the individual,the family,the community,and the nation to provide the knowledge and opportunities to promote personal excellence in the highest levels of human potential.Later on,they say there's a role for the government to assist.In research and education on techniques that promote the development of personal excellence and fuller realization of human potential.Further down,it says the duties of the commission are to advise Congress and,uh,to facilitate the fuller,uh,uh,let's see,to facilitate the fuller attainment of human potential and then it says.That this commission shall establish an independent educational and scientific nonprofit entity entitled the Center for Human Resource Development.This is to receive the contributions for the operation of the commission to perform such duties as may be assigned by the commission and to perform the duties of the commission upon the termination of the commission.So,it looks like they're setting it up so there's an ongoing thing because when it says that the,uh,commission is to terminate.Uh,the commission may apply and receive funding.00,it says when,when it's supposed to terminate,of course they,nothing ever terminates

**spk_0:** [37:19.93 - 38:45.33] at the federal government,you know that.But thank you very much,Jean,for alerting us to this bill S 135.We appreciate your giving this information to.National radio audience,I think our listeners will recognize that some of the terms you used reflect the new age practices such as our human potential and potential of body,mind and spirit and going after human resources.Uh,the federal government has got a big job.They've got to deal with the problem of what we're going to do about the impending revolution in China.They've got to deal with national defense.They've got all kinds of big problems,but we did not send our senators and representatives down there to spend our federal tax dollars to explore any of these,uh,strange concepts about human potential.And uh you are right that it almost went through if it hadn't been for Senator Coats of Indiana who put a stop on it uh when they were trying to put it through on unanimous consent without any hearings so uh it is the US Capitol.Call your US senators.Everybody listening to this program has two US senators.Call them and tell them that you do not want S-135 to set up a national commission on human resources,uh,the Pell Bill.

**spk_1:** [38:45.97 - 38:51.78] About a minute left and we go to Spokane for Anita over KUDY.

**spk_0:** [38:52.09 - 40:21.67] Hi Anita.Hello Anita.Hi Phyllis.I'm so glad to be able to talk to you.Well,good.What have you got to say about this subject?Um,I just Uh,I pulled my children out of the government schools because I didn't want to risk losing them before I had them fully developed,and I know a lot of parents are that way,and I think a lot of people are hesitant to get involved because they're starting from scratch or reinventing the wheel and I know,I know of a teacher in the Longview School District here in the state of Washington who,uh,had had enough and she ran for school board and was elected and she now has an organization called the National Education Task Force.And she goes throughout the nation at assisting citizens concerned with traditional values and our nation.Run for school board.Well,thank you very much.We're going to have to go to a break.If you'll hang on,maybe we can come back to you afterwards.Uh,what we want to do is to help those parents who still have their children in public schools.Remember,89% of the school children of America are in public schools,and we would like to help them to assert their rights.

**spk_0:** [45:23.70 - 45:27.97] Hello,Craig.How are you doing?All right,what have you got to add to this conversation?

**spk_9:** [45:28.71 - 45:35.77] Well,there are two things,uh,I find it interesting you all brought up the,uh,uh,Senate bill that,uh,Senator Pell tried to initiate,

**spk_0:** [45:36.10 - 45:37.59] right?Do you know about that?Yes,

**spk_9:** [45:37.70 - 46:47.65] uh,we heard about that,I believe it's through,uh,Marlon Maddox some time ago.Uh,the Issues that we're involved in,you know,we're a ministry that deals with cults and cult education,uh,here in Alabama,and,uh,we're talking about we're dealing with two different issues.One is the,uh,issue of the new age intrusion in schools,but you're talking about this bill that,uh,Pell introduced.There's a report that's just been put out,uh,that was commissioned by the United States Army.It was put out by the National Research Council,you know,which is chartered by the,uh,US Congress,uh,national,uh.Uh,National Academy of Sciences that came out and the name of the report was Enhancing Human Performance Issues,theories and techniques.And,uh,the report,uh,thoroughly repudiated,um,any,uh,any real validity or substance to the idea that a lot of these new age and psychic research techniques,uh,enhance human performance at all.And this is available.I mean this is very available to the Congress and the Senate because,uh,this is,it was commissioned by one of their,one of their arms.

**spk_0:** [46:48.01 - 46:51.93] And what was the organization or agency that put it out?Would you tell us that again?

**spk_9:** [46:52.08 - 47:02.28] National Academy Press,which is part of the National Academy of Sciences,National Research Council.There in Washington,which is chartered by the Congress.

**spk_0:** [47:02.80 - 47:11.12] Well,I thank you for telling us about that.Uh,did you have some experience with some of the new age concepts in the schools in Alabama?

**spk_9:** [47:11.72 - 47:38.43] Right,the,uh,several situations.One,the,uh,Birmingham schools,I think you've,uh,published this in your one of your newsletters,um.Uh,came out with a curriculum that was offered to the community.It's one of the community school programs that had 14 very overtly new age occultic classes such as astrology,uh,spirit,contact,um,uh,crystals,use of crystals,acupuncture,

**spk_0:** [47:39.89 - 47:40.03] uh,all those in the public schools.

**spk_9:** [47:41.17 - 48:21.17] This is in the public schools,uh,well,it was sponsored by the Board of Education here locally.And the city of Birmingham funded and sponsored by them and it was offered to the community.It's what they call the community school program,which is,which means that they,uh,offer it to the community in the evenings and on Saturdays,uh,using the school facilities and paying for their curriculum.Uh,we responded to that,and that's one thing it's important to know that Christians and conservatives can respond appropriately,and,uh,we called this to their attention with some documentation.This was clearly promoting the practice of religion,uh,ideology and practice of religion.

**spk_0:** [48:21.33 - 48:24.00] And how did they respond to that accusation?

**spk_9:** [48:24.33 - 48:51.37] Well,it's interesting.Uh,the,the board,uh,the,uh,the chairman of the community school program.resisted it a bit,but we took it to the,uh,Board of Education,and the president of the Board of Education didn't even know that the curriculum,what the curriculum was.I mean,the right hand didn't know what the left hand was doing when they found out they were aghast and the city councilman I contacted also was quite disturbed and they yanked the courses right away.

**spk_0:** [48:51.59 - 48:59.29] Well,that's a good example of alert citizens who can call it to the attention of the authorities,and they responded to your complaint,right?

**spk_9:** [48:59.47 - 49:05.63] Yes,they did,and uh.Another situation we're involved in right now,I know you're strapped for time,but is,uh,

**spk_0:** [49:05.99 - 49:09.79] the Huntsville be quick because we,uh,have a number of other calls waiting.OK,in the

**spk_9:** [49:09.79 - 49:42.25] Huntsville school system,they just introduced as part of their curriculum a program called Peace,Harmony and Awareness,which is a new age,uh,uh,program to enhance again human potential,reduce stress,but what it is,and the parents would be,uh,uh,appalled if they found out what was going on.It's clearly a hypnotic,uh,trance induction techniques,and they,they do this once a week to kindergarten through 6th grade and,uh,through the process of this,uh,program to reduce stress,they take them to a secret place which they visualize and create in their minds.

**spk_0:** [49:42.40 - 49:44.59] They don't really take them.This is guided fantasy,

**spk_9:** [49:44.65 - 50:06.27] guided fantasy and visualization,but,uh,it's clearly the techniques of,of self hypnosis.I mean this is very,very easily documented.And they are told to contact a white rabbit there,and this white rabbit is full of all the wisdom in the world.They can ask this white rabbit any question they want about life,any decisions they have to make,

**spk_0:** [50:06.35 - 50:08.71] and this is an elementary public school,

**spk_9:** [50:09.11 - 50:29.76] kindergarten through 6th grade.And of course this certainly militates against parental authority,church,any kind of outside authority,and it's,and it posits the position,of course,the new age position that each child has the infinite wisdom of the universe within them and that they are,we are totally good and not,uh,sinful because

**spk_0:** [50:30.94 - 50:54.20] well,thank you so much for telling us about this.That's the program called Peace,Harmony and Awareness.I believe we've heard about that in our parents advisory Center and I think it is.Federally funded,so if parents encounter this,they have every right to complain.It does come in the category of those materials that should have prior written parental consent before they are used on public school children.

**spk_1:** [50:54.29 - 52:21.39] On the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live across America.We welcome our new affiliate this week in Fayetteville,Arkansas,KOFC.Now if the information that You're gaining from this valuable program is important to you.Your help in a tangible way would be so important.If you can enclose a gift.Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.If you're serious about understanding education issues,you need to subscribe to the Education Reporter.The Education Reporter helps keep You informed about what public schools are doing throughout the United States.Find out about the alarming new age courses being taught in Alabama public schools.Did you know in a community college in New York state,students can now watch pornography for credit?Stay informed on education legislation.The Education Reporter is a monthly publication that's available to you.How about writing to Eagle-Forum.For your annual subscription.In fact,the education reporter would make a great gift idea for someone you know in the field of education.Send $25 to Eagle-Forum Education.Eagle is spelled like the American Eagle.Eagle-Forum Education,Alton,Illinois,62002.Alton is spelled A L T O N,Alton,Illinois,62002.
