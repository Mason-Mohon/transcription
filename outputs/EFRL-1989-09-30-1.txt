**spk_0:** [00:03.31 - 00:08.07] About this fall,it's witches,Satanism,and the occult in the classroom.

**spk_1:** [00:10.16 - 00:25.56] Welcome to Philly Schlafly Live and of course we'll be inviting your telephone calls,going to your telephone calls soon,by the way.So jot down our toll-free number anywhere in the United States,1-800-736-3202.

**spk_0:** [00:25.76 - 00:29.18] Bruce,let's go first of all to your special insight report.

**spk_1:** [00:30.38 - 01:05.50] There's a conflict between competing views of how public education should be run,that according to the liberal group People for the American Way in its report on censorship in the American classroom.The group found it objectionable that parents in many communities complained about material in their schools that promoted Satanism,witchcraft,and the occult,branding such parents censors.Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council in Washington agrees with People for the American Way in just one respect.Yes,he says there's a conflict on how public education should be run.

**spk_2:** [01:05.62 - 01:23.22] I think the disagreement comes in that People for the American Way and the American Civil Liberty Union and other groups would like Americans who come from a traditional perspective.To leave the public square and abandon the battlefield,Kathleen Masters

**spk_1:** [01:23.22 - 01:27.75] of Concerned Women for America calls the censorship charge a bit harsh.

**spk_0:** [01:28.02 - 01:36.70] We don't think it's fair to charge parents with censorship when they're just trying to have some input into what their children are learning in school.

**spk_1:** [01:36.86 - 01:53.96] People for the American Way refused an interview for this story.The group,however,is on record as opposing anything that promotes religion in the public schools.But some consider Satanism and witchcraft bona fide religious groups.Gary Bauer says that's inconsistent.

**spk_2:** [01:54.20 - 02:08.61] There's a good deal of evidence that groups like People for the American Way are not generally speaking concerned about all religion.They're concerned about religion.That comes from a Judeo-Christian perspective.

**spk_1:** [02:08.76 - 02:22.85] Bauer says parents have the constitutional right to assert their influence over what their children are taught,the objections of groups like People for the American Way to the contrary notwithstanding.Phyllis,you've been up against.This type of battle for a long time now.

**spk_0:** [02:23.71 - 02:48.68] Yes,I have,and when Norman Lear's People for the American Way came out this year with his so-called censorship report setting forth a state by state listing of parental complaints about school books and curricula.It was witchcraft,Satanism,and the occult that drew the largest number of complaints.Of course,Norman Lear's group thinks that the schools have the right to teach anything they want to your children.Well,

**spk_1:** [02:48.85 - 03:11.44] if you think that teaching about witches,Satanism,and the occult have no place in the public school classroom,Then stay tuned for the next hour because that's what we're going to talk about today.Give us a call and share what you've discovered about this important subject,and of course agree or disagree.Our telephone number is 1-800-736-3202.

**spk_0:** [03:11.68 - 03:36.80] We're going to go right to the phones because we're getting so many calls about witchcraft at our Eagle-Forum Parents Advisory Center that we just can't keep up with them.It seems that so many public schools have made Halloween their number one project for October.And parents are horrified at what their children are coming home with.If this has happened to you,call us so that other parents can be alerted.Let's go right to the phones,Bruce.

**spk_1:** [03:37.11 - 03:42.75] OK,let's see what we have in La Puente,California.Drury is on for you,Phyllis.

**spk_0:** [03:42.88 - 03:48.59] Hello,Drury.Yes,have you got a comment about witchcraft in the public schools?

**spk_3:** [03:48.76 - 04:11.84] I sure do.My daughter attends 3rd grade at Nelson School on the Hacienda Lapointe Unified School District.And they're on the,they've taken the 12 days of Christmas and changed it into a ghoul song for them to learn,and this comes right directly out of her reader.That they learn out of all year long.I'd like to read you.

**spk_0:** [04:11.93 - 04:18.89] You mean they did a parody on the famous Christmas song,12 Days of Christmas?Well,how about reading it to us?

**spk_3:** [04:19.01 - 05:07.50] I'll sure do that.And I'll start on the 7th day.And on the 7th day of Christmas,my true love gave to me 7 ghouls of caroling,6 shadows lurking,5 useless things,4 raven wings,3 cobwebs,2 bags of soot,and a wart snake in a fig tree.Oh,that's awful.Uh,just to give you an idea of what it finally concludes at,do you mind if I read the 12th Day?Go ahead.And,and on the 12th day of Christmas,my true love gave to me 12 days of raining,11 lizards boiling,10 groundhogs grinning,9 nightmares galloping,8 snow wolves wailing,7 ghouls a caroling,6 shadows lurking,5 useless things,4 raven wings,3 cobwebs,2 bags of soot,and a wart snake in a fig tree.

**spk_0:** [05:08.30 - 05:21.71] Well,is this somebody's idea of being cute,or do you think this is,uh,a a parody on Christmas where were the children,uh,read this aloud in class or were they,uh,taught to recite it or how was it used?

**spk_3:** [05:23.39 - 05:28.31] Uh,this,well,as far as I know they haven't used it just as of yet because it's a brand new reader,but we've approached them about it.

**spk_0:** [05:29.03 - 05:30.87] Well,it's probably planned for October.

**spk_3:** [05:31.11 - 05:48.45] Yes,I,I believe it is.And it's,uh,it's the only,they,they,I've read the teacher's edition and they speak of a couple of other,you know,the,the original 12 Days of Christmas and another one,but this is the only version that's in the child's reader,so you,we know that they're going to be reading it.

**spk_0:** [05:48.66 - 05:50.92] Do you know the name of the reader and the publisher?

**spk_3:** [05:51.42 - 06:04.31] I sure do.It's,uh,let me get it here.OK.The name of the reader is Over the Mountain,and it's part of the impression series by Holt,Reinhardt and Winston of Canada.Oh,

**spk_0:** [06:04.39 - 06:06.37] that's one of the big textbook publishers.

**spk_3:** [06:07.39 - 06:07.95] It is.

**spk_0:** [06:08.32 - 06:11.93] OK.Well,did you make any objection to the school?Have you talked to the teacher?

**spk_3:** [06:12.70 - 06:19.67] Oh,yes,we've talked to the teacher and she is,she just simply doesn't see the problem.

**spk_0:** [06:20.88 - 06:40.89] Well,of course,the teacher did not select the book that was assigned to her by somebody else and she's taught to teach out of the book that she's assigned.But uh I suppose they won't read every story in the book.Uh,could you persuade the teacher to omit the stories or so-called poems that are offensive on First Amendment grounds?

**spk_3:** [06:41.75 - 07:05.27] I haven't,I don't really know yet what we're gonna be able to do.We've,uh,so far we've just said that we will be not allowing our daughter to read.There's several stories in here.This is only one of them that we don't approve of,and,uh,we're not gonna allow her to read them,and we're,we're right now trying to somehow get this book taken out of the school because there's so many things in it that are,are,they're repulsive.

**spk_0:** [07:05.87 - 07:17.43] Well,of course,it's very difficult to um to know when that story is going to be read and so that you can uh exempt your child from it.Uh,what else is in the book that you object to?

**spk_3:** [07:18.23 - 07:26.71] Uh,there's a story in here.It's called Night or Day and Night,How They Came to be.And it's a,it's a real short one.Do you mind if I read it?

**spk_0:** [07:27.30 - 07:27.57] Go ahead.OK.

**spk_3:** [07:28.20 - 08:06.64] In those times when just saying a word could make something happen,there was no light on earth yet.Everything was in darkness all the time.People lived in darkness.A fox and a hare had an argument,each saying his magic word.Darkness,said the fox,for he wanted it to be dark so he could go hunting.Day,said the hare,for he wanted it to be daylight so he could find good grass to eat.The hare won.His word was more powerful,and he got his wish.Day came replacing night,but the word of the fox was powerful too.When the day was over,night came,and from then on they took turns with each other.The nighttime for the of the fox following the daytime of the hare.

**spk_0:** [08:07.18 - 08:12.02] Well,it sounds to me like they're teaching us that the fox and the hare created light and darkness.

**spk_3:** [08:12.69 - 08:46.85] That's,that's what they're,and there's no mention in there that it's a,a fairy tale.It's just,that's the story.And then the workbook pages that go with it are all to do with magic words.Uh,the,here we have,what might each of these animals choose as a magic word,and they go down a,a list here.The elephant's magic word might be water.They give you an example because,and the beaver's magic word might be.And they give you a blank space to decide,and woodpecker's magic word might be,the salmon's magic word might be,the frog's magic word might be.A porcupine,a mosquito.

**spk_0:** [08:47.38 - 09:10.67] Well,I suggest that you make an appointment and go see the teacher.Explain to the teacher why you consider these things offensive,offensive on First Amendment grounds that uh your family does not believe in magic.They don't believe that light and darkness were created by animals,and they don't care for the parody on the Christmas song.How about the pictures in the book?

**spk_3:** [09:11.25 - 09:14.45] Oh,the pictures are,are worse than the wording.

**spk_0:** [09:14.55 - 09:15.21] Are they scary?

**spk_3:** [09:15.80 - 09:24.50] They,they are extremely scary.Uh,we've shown them to some of the other children just to get their reaction,and they,they didn't like it at all.They don't,they don't want to read it.

**spk_0:** [09:25.09 - 09:42.71] Well,uh,we certainly thank you for alerting us to this because Holt Reinhardt Winston is one of the big publishers,and parents,you ought to be reading what's in your children's books even if they're in the 3rd grade.And we wish you well in your talk with the teacher.Thank you,Drury.We appreciate your call and we're

**spk_1:** [09:42.71 - 10:00.12] at 1-800-736-3202.This is Bruce Hayes inviting you to join us on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Quickly,uh,welcoming a new station in Elmira.New York WLNL.Let's go back to the telephone calls.Here's Susan in Dallas for Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [10:00.33 - 10:05.27] Hello,Susan.Uh,do you have a comment about witchcraft in the schools?

**spk_4:** [10:05.38 - 10:24.69] Well,yes,just in the last few weeks we've been very concerned because we have a high school daughter who has a,a teacher,a speech teacher that is having them do 10 to 15 minutes of meditation in a room with no windows.They turn out the lights.And she plays a tape of her choice.Um,

**spk_0:** [10:25.01 - 10:26.89] a tape of the teacher's choice,right?Yes,

**spk_4:** [10:26.97 - 11:00.11] and she has rotated it.She admitted for some reason she,I,I guess she thinks she's protecting herself.She was upfront about it.She called it fantasizing,um,to the class,and she told us at Open house it was meditation,but then she also told the class that there was a subliminal message in one of the tapes she'd been using something to do with not eating,and she decided not to use that tape anymore.She chose another tape then.That my daughter says the voice was so soft that it got so you couldn't understand what it was saying.Finally,

**spk_0:** [11:00.23 - 11:04.17] you know where the tapes came from?No.Do they have a name or

**spk_4:** [11:04.18 - 11:44.21] no,we do not know.And my daughter,I've told her to try to see,but she's not been able to.Last week it was just ocean music,but then she's also said.At the very first week my daughter got the impression that their grade would be affected.Then when she talked about the subliminal tapes,one little boy said he objected and said,How do I know there's not something satanic on there like telling me to go kill my parents?And she said,Well,I wouldn't put anything in here that wouldn't just make you go out feeling relaxed.But when she saw the objection in him and my daughter.She said,Well,you don't have to participate.But then it's,it's dark for 15 minutes and my daughter will try to sit there and read or,you know,but it's,she,what can she do?Yeah,

**spk_0:** [11:44.54 - 11:50.88] what,what can she do?Or what class is this supposed to be?Is this geography or mathematics or what?It's speech.

**spk_4:** [11:51.41 - 12:13.17] And then she has little exercises she's giving them like raise,raise,um.The elevator up in your mind to the count of 7 and then down,she's also done something where they kind of my daughter says it's like hypnosis where she walks them on the beach and does all this kind of you're doing this and that and then gives them the answers.I will.

**spk_0:** [12:13.46 - 12:22.14] Well,those those techniques are known as guided imagery or visualization.They're very well recognized techniques.They have no place in the public school classroom.

**spk_4:** [12:22.80 - 12:57.92] Well,she,she did this one day and then tried to get them to remember information and the odd thing was,um,my daughter,of course,was looking down,not doing this.They took the test and graded it themselves in front of everyone.Had every time they graded a question they'd say,now raise your hand,how many missed this?And for some reason all the hands went up almost all the time except for my daughter who only missed one.So I,I didn't know if she'd actually reversed,like she,OK,then she used the phrase,now you will remember everything I've told you.Along with this thing,all right,

**spk_0:** [12:58.00 - 13:00.74] now,have you taken this up with the teacher that you object to this?

**spk_4:** [13:00.85 - 13:10.84] Um,not yet.That's why I called,uh,Eagle-Forum.I,I was trying to get a hold of you or somebody that could tell me how was the best way to approach it.

**spk_0:** [13:11.16 - 14:20.02] Oh,I think I would go to see the teacher,and I would say that you object to tech techniques of visualization and guided imagery.Um,as this type of self hypnosis,uh,it's,has no place,uh,you have,uh,put your child in the speech class in order to learn how to express herself using the English language in,in an articulate way,and,uh,this doesn't involve long periods of darkness.Or silence or listening to tapes uh and uh you also find it offensive on First Amendment grounds because these techniques are allied to some of the uh occultic practices or Eastern religions or new age or whatever and can't we please get down to the business of teaching speech.And I would approach it in a nice way.It's very likely that the teacher doesn't even understand that there might be anything objectionable about this.I'm sure the teacher thinks she is doing a good thing for you.Well,I hope you try that and,and,and let us know how it works out because we,we hope that our children are getting some kind of academic instruction in the schools.Well,

**spk_4:** [14:20.11 - 14:25.57] and I would just like to say I have children from preschool to seniors in high school.And well,

**spk_0:** [14:25.58 - 14:29.65] let's try to,let's try to straighten the schools out before your preschoolers get to high school.

**spk_4:** [14:29.73 - 14:41.03] Well,and I've been the man,the caller before me,I have definitely been finding this and seeing this almost at every level,this,you know,not as severe as this,but.The books and the witchcraft.

**spk_0:** [14:41.11 - 14:44.61] Well,parents,be alert.Thank you very much,Susan,for calling.

**spk_1:** [14:44.91 - 15:05.01] Where do you stand on this whole matter of witchcraft,Satanism,and the occult?Where do you stand?Well,we'd like to hear from you at 1-800-736-3202.Yeah,we'll pick up the tab on your telephone call from anywhere in the United States on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [17:44.90 - 17:51.03] hello Brenda,have you had an experience with,uh,witchcraft in the classroom?Yes,

**spk_7:** [17:51.14 - 18:32.77] ma'am,I have.Um,it started about two weeks ago.My kindergartner,my daughter,uh,brought home a paper from school that is printed by MacMillan that had 3 beasts on it,and she was to classify faces according to sad,mad,and happy.And at that point,uh,I went to the teacher and told her,uh,you know,whatever happened to little clown faces,if we have to do this,why can't we classify them on,you know,something more innocent than these beast looking creatures.And I told her that we we believed in the Bible as Christians and uh adhered to Philippians 4:8 and you know whatever is true and lovely and dwell on these types of things and um what

**spk_0:** [18:32.77 - 18:34.41] kind of response did you get from the teacher?

**spk_7:** [18:34.62 - 19:44.28] Well,she at that point,uh,told me that that was fine and that if I wanted to provide an alternate for my daughter that would be OK and uh.So I,uh,she said at that point you might want to come back in,uh,next week.Let's set up an appointment with Halloween coming up.There are going to be a lot of activities in the classroom that you may have some objective to.And I said that would be fine and uh at that point I went back in and talked to the teacher and she said we're going to read a book about the humbug witch,which is a little girl who is dressed up like a witch and at the end of that activity the children will dress a little girl like a witch or make their own witch.And I said yes,I object to that.I would like to provide my own alternative to that.Well,when I got into my meeting with the teacher,she had an entire list of things that were not only going to be done around Halloween but the entire month.She said that they would discuss haunted houses,witches,ghosts.They would have a witch hunt,they would have ghost finger plays,as well as a story with a humbug witch,and she said everything all month long.Would be permeated with this thing

**spk_0:** [19:44.47 - 19:53.56] you mean they were going to spend the whole month of October on all kinds of activities and lessons on Halloween,witches,ghosts,

**spk_7:** [19:53.76 - 20:00.47] Practically everything they did would have,uh,you know,some correlation to that that Halloween thing.

**spk_0:** [20:00.63 - 20:07.76] Well,this would tend to make Halloween maybe the most important event of the year in the child's life.That's exactly right.So did you object?

**spk_7:** [20:08.25 - 20:27.15] I did object and at that point I said I would like for and she said,Well,if you have an objection or your daughter has an objection,she said maybe we need to get her in here and we will tell her that if she has an objection,uh,we will,uh,make sure that the child knows to go to the teacher with the objection about the material.

**spk_0:** [20:27.34 - 20:32.93] Well,since when is it up to the kindergartner to,uh,decide what should be used in the classroom,right?

**spk_7:** [20:33.17 - 21:12.35] Exactly.And in this one particular meeting,what ended up happening,my 5 year old was called in.And she read off this list that I just read to you of all the things that they're going to be doing and the 5 year old of course wants to please the teacher and so she sat there and said,OK,OK,OK,and I said wait a minute.I said,Kristen,what Mommy wants you to see is that Uh,you know,we have our beliefs in the Bible,and if this goes against what God has to say in his book,we do not want you to do it and my purpose for bringing that child in was to tell the teacher and the child in front of each other that if this child had a problem with the material that she was not to do it so that my child was.

**spk_0:** [21:12.46 - 21:16.41] But it looks to me like the teacher turned the child,uh,to be on her side.

**spk_7:** [21:16.54 - 21:45.87] That's exactly right,and I walked away from that meeting,Mrs.S Shaffly,very upset and I had another meeting with the teacher yesterday.And I told her that I was very uncomfortable about the way the meeting ended and that I didn't want,and I did not want my child to participate in anything that had to do with uh witchcraft or haunted houses or ghosts.I said I have no problem with nature such as pumpkins or fall or she said something about spiders.I said if it's presented in a factual scientific manner,that is fine with me.

**spk_0:** [21:46.38 - 21:53.14] Well,if I were you and it's,uh,they're not learning anything academic anyway,I would keep my kindergartner home for the month of October.Well,

**spk_7:** [21:53.25 - 23:00.65] that's exactly right,and I tell you,the response I got yesterday.Yesterday this kindergarten teacher called over the other two kindergarten teachers,and so it was 3 on 1,and she said,let me just bring the others in here.And,uh,I said,What is your purpose with permeating this curriculum with this theme all month long?And she said,we are here to teach these children the difference between real and fantasy.And I said,Do you mean to tell me that you believe there are not real witches,that there are not a real occult?I said,we believe in Ephesians 6,where it says that we battle not against,uh,flesh and blood but the principalities of the air.And I said,with the recent goings on in the border of Texas and Matamoros with the occult slayings,I said,Are you telling me witchcraft is not real?And she said,Well,I just totally disagree with you.I said that's fine,but I will not have my child participate in that.I said,I believe that there are real witches and demons,and we are not going to dabble in that area.So she said all three kindergarten teachers told me that I need to take it to the principal.So at Monday morning at 8:30 my husband and I are going to sit down with the principal and approach him and see why the kind.Garden curriculum is so inundated with this.Well,I,

**spk_0:** [23:00.73 - 23:29.08] I wish you well in that conversation with the principal,and I think you should also tell him that this all is an offense against your First Amendment rights,uh,for the same reason that we know that the school would not be permitted to devote the month of December to the real meaning of Christmas.It just simply would not be permitted and likewise they should not.Be able to spend the month of October teaching things which are offensive to your religion.So good luck.And if you don't get success,if I were you,I'd keep your child home.

**spk_1:** [23:29.38 - 23:33.94] Willingboro,New Jersey.Here's David over at WCHR for Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [23:33.98 - 26:03.85] Hello David.Good afternoon.Do you have some experience with these classes in the cla in the schools?Yes,I do.Um,just this year I have a daughter in 4th grade who,uh,when the schools began,we were told at the parent teachers meeting that they were introducing a new reading curriculum.That was being adopted in about 60% of the schools around the state of New Jersey.And uh the book she has is called Silver Secrets,and I was looking through it and I noticed the first chapter teaches,uh,what in occult circles is called visualization or psychopictometry.And then another chapter,about 3 or 4 chapters further down,it got into levitation,and another one gets into ESP.And they actually promote the idea of the child trying to develop these abilities in their life to improve their reading comprehension and so forth.And this is supposed to be a reading class.Well,they could have picked any inspirational story.They could have picked stories about our great American heroes.They could have picked historical stories,but instead they're,they're picking this kind of story.All of it's fiction stuff that's,I shouldn't say all of it,about 80% of the book is fiction,and it's a Very bizarre types of things.And have you complained?I am trying to gather some information so that when I make my complaint that I'll have some teeth in it because I know that.Uh,some people I've been in contact with in Colorado tried complaining and the teacher brought a lawsuit against them.Well,I would suggest that you find a couple of other parents who share your values and have children in the same class.You're always better off if there are several of you complaining about some type of a book,but in any event,I think all those things you said are an offense against your First Amendment rights,uh,for the same reason that,uh,the atheist has a right.be in the classroom and not have to endure having a prayer said in his presence.Your child should have the right to be in the public school classroom without being embarrassed or put down by any of these practices which are offensive to your religion.You know,from what I've been seeing in different parts of the country and the people I've been in contact with,it seems that whenever a Christian tries to assert their First Amendment rights,the government tries to convert,convert that into a crime.And then the next thing you know,the Christians have lawsuits brought against them.Well,I would just stand on your First Amendment rights and get some other parents to go with you,and that would be the best first step.Thanks a lot for calling,David.We do want to move along to the next caller.

**spk_1:** [26:04.33 - 26:12.13] If you need some advice,1-800-736-3202.That's the number for Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Here's Samantha in Denver.

**spk_0:** [26:12.29 - 26:19.33] Hello,Samantha.Good morning,Phyllis.Have you had some experience with witchcraft or the occult in the public school classroom?Yes,

**spk_7:** [26:19.41 - 27:21.50] I certainly have.I'm a parent and a grandparent who signed up to take some teacher recertification courses through some of the local universities to find out what's actually coming into the classrooms and what teachers are learning to do.And I've run into some that I would like to share with you.Uh,one of the,the new curriculum that that's out is called Taming Your Dragons,and I've noticed that it is in,uh,curricula catalogs throughout the country.It's written by a woman named,uh,Martha Belknap,and it's a collection of creative relaxation activities and basically tells children that they have dragons inside of them,that they've been implanted in them,that in order to keep these dragons from rising up into keep them from destroying them and harming them,they need to stay in a centered state or a relaxed state.And from the beginning of this book to the end of this particular textbook,they're just simply hypnotic exercises and guided imagery and visualization,all those things.

**spk_0:** [27:21.61 - 27:25.92] Now what is this textbook used for?Is it,is it reading or what is it?It's to

**spk_7:** [27:25.92 - 27:35.66] be incorporated.Into any curriculum teachers can use this as a supplementary textbook,and so it's not actually designated as to where it can go.

**spk_0:** [27:35.74 - 27:38.66] Is it a book of stories or a book of practices or what?It's a

**spk_7:** [27:38.66 - 27:57.67] book of practices.It has various,um,for instance,lie down comfortably and close your eyes.Imagine a clear blue summer sky overhead and notice soft white fluffy clouds.This is guided imagery.And visualization after the children learn to do their deep breathing,uh,altered states of consciousness exercises.

**spk_0:** [27:57.79 - 28:00.61] I assume this is a book for the teachers and not the children.

**spk_7:** [28:00.83 - 28:06.05] It's for the teachers to be used with the children,and it gives complete instructions for the teachers.

**spk_0:** [28:07.06 - 28:11.80] Do you,do you know,uh,whether it's being used or at what grade level?

**spk_7:** [28:12.30 - 28:37.73] Uh,recently,I got a call from a,a teacher from Arvada,uh,which is a little town in the Denver,uh,suburban area where it's being used in daycare,uh,in the public school daycare.Uh,with children who are 3 to 5 years of age and they're being taught about dragons inside of them and,and the information that that teacher was able to gather was that children were very,very frightened by this.

**spk_0:** [28:38.31 - 28:44.45] Well,Samantha,would you stand by?We have to take a break now,but we'd like to hear a little bit more about what you have to say.

**spk_1:** [28:44.79 - 29:06.69] And of course when we do return,we'll be taking more of your telephone calls at 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.Witchcraft,the occult,and a lot more interesting conversation with one of America's most admired and respected women on the USA Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_5:** [29:07.65 - 30:08.73] A national panel reported that 25% of 17-year-olds are functional illiterates.Another 40% are marginal illiterates.That means nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science.What have they been doing all those years in public schools?Sex education,death education,new age meditation,and other non-academic psychological activities.This can be stopped.US law gives you,the parents,primary control over your children's education.Find out about your rights.Read the Education Reporter.It's a monthly newspaper from Eagle-Forum.The education reporter keeps you informed about offensive school curricula and about victories won by parents who assert their rights.Write for a free sample of the education reporter.The address Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.

**spk_1:** [30:19.34 - 30:34.86] Welcome back to the nationwide call-in program Phyllis-Schlafly Live on the USA Radio Network,which is the occult,you know,Phyllis,for so long,uh,we've heard that Halloween is fun.I mean,why not?What's it going to hurt to go out and spook some people?

**spk_0:** [30:35.23 - 31:39.31] We're not just talking about children dressing up in funny costumes.We're talking about the witches and the ghosts and the.Satanic methods invading the public school classroom we're talking about as one of these callers said a few minutes ago,the entire month of October being taken over to readings,lessons,activities that all have to do with witches and all kinds of uh cult or magic practices and that doesn't belong in the public school classroom.I have here a uh a whole series of letters from.The Wall Street Journal,uh,which show that,um,how,uh,one,covenant of witches has gotten tax exemption as a as a legitimate religion,and we all know religion is not supposed to be in the public school classroom.Well,let's go back.I want to let Samantha make one other point before we go to another call.OK,terrific.Are you there?Are you still there,Samantha?Yes,well,you told us about the book that was being used with teachers so that they could use some of these practices in the classroom.Did you have anything further to add to that?

**spk_7:** [31:39.52 - 31:53.76] Well,yes,I would like to say that this particular practice,taming your dragons,the practice of implanting something within a child is actually used by witches and Satanists in order to keep children under control.Well,

**spk_0:** [31:53.84 - 31:59.04] we had one parent call in who said her child was taught that she had a wise man living inside of her.

**spk_7:** [31:59.35 - 32:12.01] Um-hum.Same,it's the same concept,and it frightens children and,and it,uh,then they will do whatever they're told to do,whether it's meditation or centering or,or just be obedient to to whoever's in control of them.

**spk_0:** [32:12.32 - 32:17.05] Do you think they're being used like a,like a drug on the children to as a sedative?

**spk_7:** [32:17.33 - 33:14.18] Yes,as,as a complete controlling mechanism.I would like to make one more comment,and I think this might pull together some,some real questions when people try to figure out where new age and witchcraft and all this come,come,come together.There was a woman who spoke here at the University of Denver.Her name is Miriam Starhawk.She calls herself a goddess worshiping pagan witch,and she wrote a book called,uh,The Spiral Dance in which she says that there are 4 basic principles to magical training for witches,and the first skill that these people need to learn is total relaxation.And then concentration or focusing on a center point or clearing of the mind,visualization,which means implanting a picture within the mind that they want to have happen or become reality,and then projection,which is either projecting that picture into reality or astral projection outside the body.And this is where we're finding the integration of witchcraft into new age and into the public schools.All right,

**spk_0:** [33:14.30 - 33:28.89] so the part that we are really concerned about on this program is what's going on in the classroom,and it certainly is clear that they are using practices of uh meditation and guided imagery and visualization.Thank you very much,Samantha for calling.We'll go to our next caller

**spk_1:** [33:29.21 - 33:33.89] in Marianna,Florida over WJNS.Here's Vera.

**spk_0:** [33:34.09 - 33:39.21] Hello Vera.Do you have experience with this subject?No,not really.

**spk_7:** [33:39.30 - 34:26.20] I just called to comment on the instructors,the Uh,kindergarten right through high school instructors that stand firm in their beliefs,their Christian beliefs.Uh,our granddaughter now attends a local elementary school,and her kindergarten teacher is a wonderful Christian woman.That's great stands firm in her beliefs and at our first PTO meeting instructed us about the different parties throughout the year that she would be having and when Halloween was mentioned.Uh,she,she didn't say that we couldn't do something,but she said,let's not do anything scary.Let's do pumpkins.Let's do leaves.Let's do happy things.And I just think that we need to really lift these instructors up.They're a little fish in a big pond.And they need our prayers and they need our support.

**spk_0:** [34:26.43 - 34:41.98] Well,thank you very much for that positive answer and also it gives a good suggestion to those who are complaining about the scary stuff.They can say,why don't you try pumpkins,leaves,and the other evidences of fall and nature.Thank you for your call very much.

**spk_1:** [34:42.35 - 35:11.60] And if you're just joining us,we're talking about cults,which is,uh,the whole bits as we approach October and kids start thinking about Halloween.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Come on in.Let's hear from you.1-800-736-3202.Phyllis,real quickly,I was,uh,looking at some of the papers you have there,a whole list of parents who call your advisory.Center at Eagle-Forum expressing complaints.Uh,can you review some of those with

**spk_0:** [35:11.60 - 36:05.15] us?Well,they're objecting to all kinds of things.In Georgia,parents were objecting to the excessive number of books in school libraries dealing with the occult and Satanism.Uh,some of the libraries say they are the most frequently checked out books.Uh,in Iowa,uh,parents were objecting to children being given a book because it definitely promotes Satanism.In an Illinois district,the parents objected to the use of a book because of its stories of demonic power and possession,and they felt that was very unsuitable for sixth graders in,uh,Florida.Parents were objecting to a book because they thought it would lead children to a life of devil worship.Now these are legitimate complaints,and these are the kind of complaints that when they are registered by parents with the schools,Norman Lear's People for the.The American Way calls that censorship,but we think it's the parents asserting their First Amendment rights.

**spk_1:** [36:05.30 - 36:14.05] Let's hear from some parents out there.1-800-736-3202 in Whittier,California.We go to Jerry for Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [36:14.25 - 38:13.42] Hello,Jerry.Hi.What is your question or comment?Well,I,I'm just real concerned about the impression series that our school system has recently gotten.Um,in the 6th grade there's a C.Uh,in the 1st 6 months of the year they use one book,and in that book I see 12345678.There's 8 stories that have to do with witches,witchcraft,spells,definition,and superstitions.And even in the first grade book,they have a story about,you know,feeding,you know,your children spider stew and mashed worms and things like that that are kind of witchy,you know,so I just think that's really inappropriate.Well,I certainly do too.Have you taken it up with the school?I've talked to a district,two ladies in the district to help decide that this is the book that we were going to have,and they thought nothing.You know,they thought it was a wonderful series that no,this doesn't affect children,and they can't remember anything like that affecting them when they were little.Well,they probably didn't have stories like that when they were little,but one problem I think we have is that many adults see things with adult eyes and they don't realize the different effect that it can have on children.Right,it's fascinating to children.Have you,uh,taken it up with the,uh,teacher to say that you would appreciate the,uh,if they did not use those stories that you find so offensive?Usually they usually in any reader they don't read all the stories.You haven't done that yet.No,I was,um,I tried to,you know,since this,the book is district-wide,I was trying to.You know,impress on it districtwide,but they're not responding,so I'm going to have to respond individually and,you know,encourage other parents to do the same thing.Yes,right.Well,you bring it to the attention of other parents who share your values.Thank you so much for calling,Jerry.

**spk_1:** [38:13.92 - 38:20.88] Let's take another telephone call to Reno,and she's calling from Amber,Wisconsin.Oh hello.

**spk_0:** [38:20.96 - 38:22.46] What is your question or comment?

**spk_0:** [38:51.91 - 39:00.95] Well,I've been hoping for years that when one of these tragic events takes place,uh,they would go right back to see what the children had been taught in the classroom.

**spk_7:** [39:01.11 - 39:10.51] The the the parents of the family are so shattered by the event they do not know what to do,but uh.

**spk_0:** [39:11.16 - 39:15.84] And then time goes on and then it's very difficult to find out what was taught in the classroom.

**spk_7:** [39:16.84 - 39:58.56] If parents that are having difficulty with children and their mood swings and the things that,uh,you know,you get so much natural in puberty,but you can tell when the things are not going.And go back to seeing what this,uh,Satanism and this,uh,death wish and death watch and,uh,dying and all of this,where they are glorifying death and taking of the,uh,of their lives,and they will Find that uh their children that the base of it.A has been implanted right there

**spk_0:** [42:40.58 - 42:44.28] Here's Lena.Hello Lena,what is your comment on this subject?

**spk_8:** [42:44.50 - 44:13.78] I just wanted to ask you a question.Do you think this was a demonic,uh,attitude that the teacher is teaching my little granddaughter about dragons,uh,and the monsters?She came home about two weeks ago.She had a monster draw,uh,well,it was on a,on a photographic machine,and then she had to draw this monster with 3 eyes and 3 horns and,uh,3 legs.OK,I kind of felt queer about that.She has an attitude with me that,uh,she's pulling away from me.She won't have nothing to say.She,she,uh,like she's staring off in space,and that's not like her.She's a very jolly little girl,and,uh,last night she came home from school.She was,when she came up the steps,I reached for her books,you know,to talk with her.I always put my arm around and talk to her.And she snatched away from me and passed by me and went on in the door,and she stayed that way until I made her,she called it a pudding.I made up a little layer of cake,you know,and she got OK and she was all smiles and after that she just went back into this cocoon I call it.So she went in the room and laid down on the throw rug by my bed and she said,Granny,she said,uh,could a snake bite you if he's on a pitcher?I said,no.So she said the teacher had us talking about snakes today.So that frightened me and with the attitude she had,she laid there all night long.She didn't talk to me this morning when she got up,her mother picked her up.She goes to work at night.Her mother does,and she has the uh uh the uh.

**spk_0:** [44:15.32 - 44:27.07] Well,it's hard to say whether they're doing anything actually wrong in the classroom,but I think you should go find out.I would go complain that the child is very scared,and there's no reason why the child has to be scared.Well,

**spk_8:** [44:27.20 - 44:42.14] she has an attitude like she's been.I heard you say this morning something about like it was meditating.That's the attitude she has.I've seen people meditate and they have that swoony look,you know,so she comes home and that's the way she actually been doing it ever since she started the school.

**spk_0:** [44:42.74 - 45:20.44] Well,there's a,there's a pretty good new book that's out called Lambs to the Slaughter by Joanna Michaelson.I hope we can get her on this program sometime,but it's a very good book that explains to parents how these,uh,witchcraft or satanic or occult practices and new age practices are used in the classroom and uh tells parents what to do about them.If I were you,I would simply go ask to see the stories that the child had read and tell the teacher that you were concerned because she was scared and that would be a good start and then you could find out what else is going on.So thank you,thank you very much,Lena for your call.I think we have to go to another call.

**spk_1:** [45:20.79 - 45:30.05] We certainly do at 1-800-736-320.To to Indianapolis,Indiana over WXIR and Bill for Phyllis-Schlafly.Hello Bill,

**spk_0:** [45:30.11 - 48:12.77] what is your question or comment on this subject?Well,Phyllis,I just wanted to read you a couple of papers or one paper.My son has 20 papers he has to do this month dealing with Halloween,20 papers.Yes,out of 20 out of 25.He has 25 to choose from,and one of them,when we got our attention,my wife went and talked to the teacher the other day.The first one he brought home was application form for a witch apprentice.It's got the address,International Broom Riders Division of Witchery,Spooky side somewhere,and it's got an address.And it's got a list of things on there you had to fill out.It says your signature and then your professional name.Do not use your real name.What is your past experience and ask questions like,are you afraid of heights,depths,tight places?What characterizations do you prefer to form to cast a spell,you must develop your own incantation.What will yours be?And this is a paper that was given to your son in the classroom,and what grade is that?6th grade.Oh,you should go have a conference with the teacher,and if you don't get any satisfaction then with the principal right away.That is really outrageous.Would they have,uh,passed around an application to join the First Baptist Church,for example?That's what I thought.Uh-huh.That's right.Isn't that the same thing?I think so.Well,the teacher said that she would give him or to my wife.May have to make this up alternate work,but it just doesn't seem right that the other children have to do this either.No,no,I would say that that is very offensive to your First Amendment rights.Many people think that witchcraft and witches are,are a religion,and that has no place in the public school classroom.And your your child is supposed to write 20 papers in the next month.Is that what you said for creative writing,some of them are,uh,or most of them are papers where he just filled in the blank.I think some of me has to write some stories on.I haven't got all of them here,but.Uh,it goes into the history of Halloween and tells about the Celts and talking about the souls of the dead and the evil spirits and And their strange religions.Well,you,we certainly do thank you for alerting parents all over the country on all of our listening stations to what is going on.Parents,go find out what's going on in your children's schools this month.Would you go farther than just getting your child out of this though,or do you think?Yes,I would complain for the same,for the same reason that we don't allow religion in the classroom.We should not allow this,all these lessons about witchcraft and Satanism and the occult.

**spk_1:** [48:12.95 - 48:22.16] Would you complain?He doesn't know you well enough,Phyllis.We go to.We go out to KCIV Turla,California,and here's Sam.

**spk_0:** [48:22.38 - 48:25.70] Hello,Sam.Do you have a question or comment?Yeah,

**spk_9:** [48:25.74 - 48:48.00] I have a comment.On that last call that you just received.I noticed the paper that he gave,or the paper that he was referring to.Um,when he said you have to develop an incantation and what will yours be,um,I don't agree with that.That should be kept out of the classrooms,but some of these calls that you have been receiving about,uh,oh,you made reference earlier to,

**spk_0:** [48:48.04 - 48:52.76] you mean,you mean you do agree that that should be kept out of the classroom.Yes,I do.Thank you.

**spk_9:** [48:53.14 - 49:34.96] I do.Um,some of the calls that you have been receiving,however,uh,there was one earlier somebody made reference to spider stew or something like that.Uh.Some of those stories,in my opinion,I guess,I don't know.Apparently some people don't agree with me.Um,some of those stories I would think are just,you know,in fun and,uh,don't really have any effect on,on the student.I mean,I don't know any first graders that have gone home and whipped up a batch of spider stew and started feeding it to their friends.Uh,but,you know,I,I do agree with you that,uh,trying to get kids interested in.You know,witches,

**spk_0:** [49:35.00 - 49:49.03] and,well,you make a good point,but I,I think maybe the best answer to that would be whether it's age appropriate.Some things are,are OK at one grade level that are not OK at another grade level.So thank you,we appreciate your call,Sam.Phyllis,

**spk_1:** [49:49.04 - 50:03.84] I'll be interested to get your closing comments.So many people are still holding on the lines,but we will have another program on this subject of witchcraft and the occults coming in the near future.Stay with us on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis Shchlafly Live.
