**spk_0:** [00:02.69 - 00:11.95] Sex education in public schools prevent teen pregnancy?No,it increases teen pregnancy.Let's talk about the hottest issue in education today.

**spk_1:** [00:13.20 - 00:54.86] Sex education in the classrooms is definitely one of the most controversial matters revolving in our public schools today,and for the next hour you'll hear the informed conservative perspective of Phyllis-Schlafly.Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live,the call-in program that addresses parents' rights and education.New affiliates this week over the USA Radio Network,KICO Calexico,California.And WXTL Jacksonville,Florida,our toll-free number from anywhere in America,1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.I'm Bruce Hayes.Saturday,June 17th.Phyllis,great to see you again,Mike's side.

**spk_0:** [00:55.18 - 02:39.31] Thank you.If you go down the street,Bruce,and you take a poll on whether or not people want sex education in the public schools.You will find that the big majority will say yes.Uh,what they don't realize is that sex education means different things to different people.Some people want sex ed that describes every type of technique of sexual behavior from the normal to the kooky,and I do mean kooky,without any values or guidance,without telling the children what is healthy or unhealthy.A lot of state legislatures in the last couple of years have mandated sex education,some of them from kindergarten to 12th grade,you know,there isn't any other subject we teach for 13 years,not reading,writing,uh,math,spelling,or anything else,but they wanted.Teach sex for 13 years.Then when sex ed goes into the schools,you find the ACLU and People for the American Way,uh,prevent teaching any guidance about what is right or wrong.They don't even teach what is healthy or unhealthy.I hope we'll have some callers today who will tell us what's really going on.Our number is 800-736-3202.This is a subject that is not very well covered on the national media,but I did notice that on Crossfire,the debate program on CNN this week,they had a debate on a hot issue in Fairfax County,Virginia.Uh,they had a black preacher,uh,defending moral values and saying we can teach our children to say no,and then some professor who wants to put sex ed in kindergarten through 12th grade.

**spk_1:** [02:39.98 - 02:43.67] Can that age group really understand a matter like sex education?

**spk_0:** [02:43.83 - 02:54.25] Oh,they want to teach them,uh,all the names for all the private parts and acts,and you'd be amazed what they are trying to teach them.No,I don't think they can understand it,but that's what they want to do.

**spk_1:** [02:54.56 - 02:58.95] Obviously teens don't even understand it.Uh,thus we've got a lot of problems right now.

**spk_0:** [02:59.02 - 03:10.62] Well,the big problem is,uh,they use what's called values clarification,which generally means teaching teens and children they can do anything they want to do.Have we got any callers on this subject?

**spk_1:** [03:10.81 - 03:18.36] Oh yeah,we've got a switchboard fool at 1-800-736-3202.Let's start in Arlington,Virginia.Here's Helen,Phyllis.

**spk_0:** [03:18.50 - 03:19.42] Good morning,Helen.

**spk_2:** [03:19.58 - 03:41.89] Good morning.Uh,I live in Arlington,which is right next to Fairfax.County and what's happening here in Virginia,we are in the throes of a battle over sex education throughout the state because about a year and a half ago our state,uh,legislature mandated that every school district in the state must teach what they're calling family life education.Is that

**spk_0:** [03:41.89 - 03:43.41] another word for sex education?Yes,

**spk_2:** [03:43.42 - 04:18.44] it is.It encompasses other things,but it,it definitely includes sex ed,and it's required now to be taught from kindergarten through at least the 10th grade.But what they did,uh,they allowed the local districts a little bit of flexibility,and they were required to appoint what they called a community involvement team in each district which was to recommend.A curriculum or or objectives for that district and then report back to the school boards and so this past year these community involvement teams have been holding meetings and public hearings.

**spk_0:** [04:18.55 - 04:22.34] Well,did they have on these teams or were they pretty well dominated?

**spk_2:** [04:22.47 - 04:47.88] Well,I know what happened here in Arlington.Uh,the,the CIT had about 30 members and only one of them out of all the members has the,the pro.traditional moral value philosophy.Many of the others were,uh,administrators.They were,uh,people who were involved in the school system,either employees or closely related to it.And so it really was not in any way a cross section of the community.

**spk_0:** [04:48.20 - 04:58.56] Do you feel,do you feel that the school people like this are rather intimidating to parents,uh,because the school people present themselves as experts and Uh,presume that parents don't know anything about sex.Oh,

**spk_2:** [04:58.61 - 05:07.09] absolutely.And in fact,the,the requests for parental involvement in the curriculum were just they fell on deaf ears at every turn.So what

**spk_0:** [05:07.09 - 05:11.03] kind of a curriculum did this CIT or community involvement team come up with?

**spk_2:** [05:11.17 - 05:56.96] Well,I've been,uh,receiving it in segments according to grades,and the,the things that the parents object to the most we had a big hearing here in Arlington last month.And there were so many parents who came to speak against this thing that they didn't all,it went on until midnight and they still didn't all get to speak,but one of the main things we object to is that the material is not brought in at an age appropriate level.For example,in the,the first grade where some children are still 5 years old,one of the goals was to teach them correct terminology for the human sexual organs,and that's just far too young and not at all necessary.They were to bring up AIDS in the 6th grade.And there's no way that you can teach about AIDS without talking about homosexual behavior.Well,

**spk_0:** [05:57.04 - 06:44.00] I saw,I saw one,newspaper report on this controversial Fairfax one that,uh,said that,uh,one grade they want to teach them about autoerotic asphyxia deaths.Now,um,uh,most people don't know what this is.I didn't even know what it was at all until about a year ago we had one of these sad events in our town.Uh,but this is apparently supposed to be a kooky ultimate in sexual behavior in which you engage in some type of,uh,self-indulgence and hang yourself at the same time,and that's supposed to be,uh,more exciting than a bigger high.Now no child is going to think of that himself,uh,but if you tell him about it in the course,that's,I would think it would be an open invitation to experimentation.

**spk_2:** [06:45.09 - 07:01.93] Well,I agree.Uh,it seems to me that one of their goals is to desensitize very young children to the whole subject of sexuality,which destroys their natural,uh,modesty and reticence and that's one of the safeguards that we have against teen pregnancy.Doctor,

**spk_0:** [07:01.96 - 07:14.39] uh,Melvin Anchell has,has spoken out very strongly on that.He said there's a latency period from ages 6 to 12,uh,when children just simply should not be upset with talk and discussion about sex.

**spk_2:** [07:15.54 - 07:43.05] Well,one of the worst things in this Arlington,um,list of goals,I thought,is presented as an abstinence-based curriculum,and they do,uh,advocate that the youngsters remain sexually abstinent until marriage.But in the 9th grade they turn right around and teach them about contraception and abortion.And so it seems to me it's sending a mixed message to these teenagers,and that's one of the things that most parents here have been objecting to.Well,

**spk_0:** [07:43.13 - 08:09.21] the net result of that type of teaching is that it tells,uh,the children that everything's OK.Uh,whatever you decide,it's up to you to decide.And in fact,isn't that what values clarification is?It,uh,tells the child that you make up your own moral law.You decide whether it's OK to lie or steal or engage in sex or whatever.And,uh,uh,these courses,have you been through the whole curriculum?

**spk_2:** [08:09.69 - 08:39.09] Yes,I have.I've actually,uh,been following this at the state level for over a year,and all of,all of the proposed curricula have this,uh,decision making approach which is one of the things I objected to at the outset.They,they're assuming that if you give,uh,youngsters both sides the reasons for and not to do something that they will come to the right decision themselves,but youngsters don't operate on that very logical,

**spk_0:** [08:39.23 - 09:30.53] but that's on the basis that any decision they make is an OK decision and any decision isn't an OK decision,uh,because while we're prohibited from telling them what God's law is,uh,we certainly ought to be able to tell them what's healthy and what's unhealthy.And they don't even do that in many of these sex ed courses.Uh,I noticed that Planned Parenthood is very active in this.Uh,did you know that there is,um,as a Planned Parenthood newsletter.Uh,which,uh,brags about Virginia,your state,and Iowa,which passed comprehensive kindergarten through 12th grade sexuality mandates,uh,in their legislature last year,and then says that Planned Parenthood has targeted Ohio,Iowa,Connecticut,Illinois,and Texas for the next,uh,legislation that would mandate similar courses.

**spk_2:** [09:31.26 - 09:47.32] Well,they are very well funded,of course,and at,at every public hearing that I attended they had paid lobbyists speaking on their behalf and of course all of our people were working as volunteers and,and don't have that advantage but yes they're very evident in Virginia.

**spk_0:** [09:47.54 - 09:54.90] I heard that at the Virginia Beach School Board,uh,1500 people came out to,uh,one of these,uh,school board meetings.Did you hear that?

**spk_2:** [09:55.18 - 10:04.44] I had heard about that,yeah,they had an overflowing crowd.Uh,again,I think the public is just beginning to really be aware of this in Virginia.Um,well,

**spk_0:** [10:04.70 - 10:13.75] how do you explain that Virginia,which we think is kind of a,almost a Bible Belt,uh,Southern state,uh,how did they pass this last year in their legislature?Well,

**spk_2:** [10:13.86 - 10:35.58] I think it was sold to the legislators as a way of bringing down the rate of teen pregnancy.And we tried and tried to tell them at the committee hearings that in fact the,the two counties in Virginia that had the highest rate of teen pregnancy,which were Falls Church and Alexandria,had for years an extensive sex ed program in their curriculum,and so,

**spk_0:** [10:35.87 - 10:52.06] so you don't think that sex ed reduces teen pregnancy in no way.I suppose the reason for that is because it makes,uh,sexual,uh,behavior,uh,OK.It's an acceptable type of behavior,uh,to those who have taken these courses.Well,

**spk_2:** [10:52.54 - 10:58.77] particularly when the teachers are,you know,hold that the philosophy themselves that it's,well,

**spk_0:** [10:58.86 - 10:59.10] what would

**spk_2:** [10:59.10 - 10:59.69] you

**spk_0:** [10:59.69 - 11:00.74] recommend for parents to do?

**spk_2:** [11:01.10 - 11:55.96] Well,I think the ultimate solution for us in Virginia is going to be at the ballot box,you know,we don't even elect our school boards.They're appointed and so,um.There's not very much we can do electorally at the local level because you have to elect a county board and then the school board terms are staggered and it takes years to get a better school board,but luckily we have a race for governor coming up this fall and the lines are very clearly drawn now between the two candidates because the Democrat candidate is Lieutenant Governor Douglas Wilder and he,uh,When the legislature was considering making this a local option,which would have been much preferable to the state mandate,uh,the Senate was tied on that issue,and Lieutenant,we begged Lieutenant Governor Wilder to vote.To make it local option,but instead he broke the tie in favor of the state mandate,and he's one of the candidates for governor.Well,

**spk_0:** [11:56.06 - 11:58.13] you make him answer for that at the polls.

**spk_2:** [11:58.25 - 11:58.26] These,

**spk_0:** [11:59.98 - 12:15.31] these are the people who always claim that Christians are trying to impose their views on other people's children.It looks like the Planned Parenthood types are trying to impose their views on other people's children.Well,thank you very much,uh,Helen,for calling in.Good luck in your battle.Thank you.

**spk_2:** [12:16.21 - 12:17.12] Bye bye.And let's

**spk_1:** [12:17.12 - 12:21.08] move on to Lufkin,Texas.It's Stephanie for Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [12:21.28 - 12:25.68] Hello,Stephanie.Yes,hello.Have you had a sex ed battle in your town?

**spk_3:** [12:25.88 - 13:01.58] Yes,we have.We've had one in my town and also in our state here in Texas.I was listening to,uh,the other lady on the phone,and I noticed that,uh,you mentioned an article that I also have from Planned Parenthood that does target Texas.And goes into a whole description of how they are one of the main states that they're working in and uh gives a whole description of how they worked in a particular city to introduce a sex ed program that was and that was Houston.That was held up by then the Central Education Agency here in Texas as one of the pioneers in,in,uh,

**spk_0:** [13:01.87 - 13:11.51] Texas.In your experience,are they always going for this kindergarten through 12th grade mandate?They want,they want to impose it on all grades and all children,right?

**spk_3:** [13:11.87 - 13:54.86] Yes,in fact,in this article,it,um,It describes how they won't settle for anything less than that because it says,and I'll quote here for a second,it says integrating sexuality education into all of the disciplines is ideal,but without teacher training and a mandate,it is impossible,so they want a mandate from the state.And they want to be able to do the teacher training and they also want to integrate it into every class at every age and that way parents will not be able to find it and they will not be able to get it out when they do find it because you cannot,uh,take your child out of science class the way you could take your child out of,uh,Sex education class.Well,

**spk_0:** [13:55.02 - 14:02.95] hang,hang on,Stephanie.I think we have to,um,break for announcements.Um,uh,we might have a minute afterwards for you to tell us about your town.OK,

**spk_1:** [14:03.30 - 15:41.15] OK.And when we do return,we will return to Stephanie,and for your information,we're at 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-7.363202.We'd like to hear from you.Phyllis-Schlafly Live on Parents' rights and Education is a weekly program dealing with the significant aspects regarding education in America.You're hearing the experience pro-family perspective of P Phyllis-Schlafly on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Eagle-Forum Education wants to keep you up to date on current legislation affecting our public schools.That's why you need to subscribe to The Education Reporter.The Education Reporter is a monthly newsletter that keeps you informed on what the public schools are really doing.Read the alarming news on how ACLU policies are impacting education today.And how abstinence now continues to be the theme in discussions of sex education across America despite opposition from Planned Parenthood and the ACLU.The education reporter is must reading if you have children in the public schools.Plus,this newsletter would be a practical gift idea for someone you know in the field of education.For an annual subscription,send $25 to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.Eagle is spelled like the American Eagle Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_0:** [18:12.38 - 18:22.59] still there,Stephanie?Well,can you tell our listeners how you organized in your area?To maintain good values in sex education courses in your schools.What did you do?

**spk_2:** [18:23.13 - 18:23.57] Well,

**spk_3:** [18:24.01 - 19:05.53] what we did,uh,came out of an idea from actually an administrator in our school district.He thought he could get rid of us,I think,by saying that we needed to get approval for our ideas from the community.And so what we began to do is we began to we,we put together a presentation.And we began to call community groups and say we,uh,would like to talk to you about an,uh,sex education,a new idea in sex education,and we'd like to speak for your group.And the type of groups that we,we gave this presentation to were Lions Clubs or Rotary Clubs.All communities have,uh,civic-minded.Did you go and

**spk_0:** [19:05.53 - 19:10.73] did you go and speak yourself?Well,have you ever spoken on sex in public before?

**spk_3:** [19:11.01 - 19:18.21] No,as a matter of fact,every time I thought,gosh,I really ought to start this out by saying I can't believe I'm here to talk to you about this.

**spk_0:** [19:18.33 - 19:26.11] You know,I can't believe I'm talking about it too.If anybody had told me 5 years ago that I'd be talking on the radio about sex,I wouldn't have believed it.Well,

**spk_3:** [19:26.29 - 19:42.68] I think that that's one of the main reasons why we aren't winning in this area.is because most of the people believe the same things that that we believe,but it's such a touchy area that we can't,number one,inform people what actually is being taught because we don't say things like that.

**spk_0:** [19:42.77 - 19:45.16] No,it's indecent to talk about on the radio or in public,

**spk_3:** [19:45.81 - 19:50.44] and people don't believe it unless they see the actual.Things that are being taught.

**spk_0:** [19:50.76 - 19:53.98] So,so you and your friends went around and talked to different groups and then what happened?

**spk_3:** [19:54.20 - 21:38.45] Well,then what we did is we gave them a little presentation and the presentation included why we got involved and we showed examples of the things that we had seen.And then we did a little bit of research and we talked about what,what was being taught in sex education now and then we,um,went on to say what William Bennett recommended for sex sex education and why what what we were using now did not work and then we showed a film that was provided,uh,that we bought from Project Respect.Which is,uh,the,the sex respect curriculum,and the film was really the trick and the key to our success.We would show this film and it would inspire and educate and inform people on what we could do that would make a positive impact in sex education.And when the people in the groups viewed this film almost without exception,they thought this is great,we have to,we have got to have this in our school.And and yes we did.We ended up,uh,we would,we would ask people would say,well.Are we going to have this and we said we're just,um,educating the community and after we had about 500 people that we had showed the video to,we decided to go before the school board and ask them to institute sex respect in our school district and they,they'd had seen the video also and,uh,they voted unanimously to accept it in our school district and then immediately almost following that another school district that was adjacent to ours.Well,I,I think that that is,uh,something,a procedure that even people who cannot speak before groups could have printout sheets,fact sheets,tell them a little bit about what's going on,show the video,and people will say this is great.

**spk_0:** [21:38.70 - 21:48.72] Well,that's a good example of how parents could,uh,get their views to prevail at the school board level.So thank you,Stephanie,for giving us this.Inspiration.It's an example that other people can follow.

**spk_1:** [21:48.94 - 21:55.77] And now we're in Virginia Beach,Virginia,and it's George for one of America's most admired and respected women.Here's Phyllis.

**spk_0:** [21:55.94 - 22:01.90] Hello,George.Hi Phyllis,how are you today?OK.Are you in this,uh,Virginia controversy on sex ed?

**spk_4:** [22:02.13 - 22:24.99] We sure are.We're up to our neck in this thing,and,and,uh,the thing that's been most encouraging to us,Phyllis,is Just the,the fact that we could start out with 10 or 15 people about 3 or 4 months ago and we had somewhere between 12 and 1500 show up at our last school board meeting,it absolutely made Virginia history and people were,

**spk_0:** [22:25.00 - 22:28.65] that's a lot of people in Virginia Beach.It'd be a lot of people in Chicago.

**spk_4:** [22:29.05 - 23:06.34] It,it's a lot of people anywhere,but we,we found out that,uh,by doing similar things to the,the previous caller.Although we did not go after specific civic groups,what we did was to just inform our own group and ask them to invite their people,and then we set up public meetings at our public library.And we passed out flyers in all the supermarkets in the uh in as many churches as would receive it and announcing that we were going to have a discussion on family life education and sex education.

**spk_0:** [23:06.58 - 23:11.68] Well,when you talk about it,did you have specific pages from the curriculum to which you objected?

**spk_4:** [23:12.30 - 23:53.73] Well,we were very fortunate in that.They had already taught the teachers,trained the teachers in Norfolk,our next door neighbor's city,neighboring city,and we got a hold of one of the textbooks,and it was just absolute pornography in many people's opinion,and values were,it was valueless,it was amoral,and everything was treated equally with equal validity and Um,so there was so much damaging material in it that um that that it was quite easy to just open a page and read from the page,and we got people in the library so excited about it that they went and told their friends.In other words,

**spk_0:** [23:53.81 - 23:58.70] you use the curriculum from a neighboring district to show how.Bad it could be and what it might be in your district.

**spk_4:** [23:59.03 - 24:21.70] That's right,because this was approved on the state level.Now in Virginia this has been mandated.Virginia was one of the targeted states by,I believe,a group such as Planned Parenthood or one of that,another similar group to them.Uh,as,as a state for comprehensive and sequential sex education,that's sort of a key word,

**spk_0:** [24:22.01 - 24:26.63] isn't comprehensive a word that means including talking about contraceptives and abortion.

**spk_4:** [24:27.13 - 24:44.92] Yeah,it means as much as they can get into the program,and sequential means that they have to do it in a series over,over a series of years building on what they learned the previous year,reviewing it and continuing it.So ours is a 10 or 12 year program depending on which school district you're in.

**spk_0:** [24:45.03 - 24:49.31] So where are you?The fight now,have you,have you won or lost or still hanging in there?

**spk_4:** [24:49.84 - 25:17.24] Well,I'd say that we're maybe in the 3rd inning in a 9 inning ballgame.The school board has heard the outcry of the public,and they have decided to take the recommendations of the so-called community involvement team,and,and file them away and develop some new guidelines from which they will develop the curriculum.And so we are.Uh,waiting to hear back what the school board is doing with it.

**spk_0:** [25:17.48 - 25:22.11] Well,good luck.We'll wish you every success.Thanks for calling and we'll go to another call.

**spk_1:** [25:22.48 - 25:31.56] Well,I'll tell you what,we'll go to another call,and it's Kathleen in Chicago,Illinois at 1-800-736-30.202 for Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [25:31.80 - 25:32.80] Hello,Kathleen.

**spk_7:** [25:33.07 - 26:01.54] Hello,Phyllis.I'm very happy to be able to have this opportunity.Your two previous callers there were,uh,very pertinent to what I'd,uh,been going through,and I'd like to add some hopeful signs,you might say.Uh,we have found that with the pilot testing of the sex respect program,which is now in its 4th year.We continue to see just an incredible positive attitude improvement in all the schools.

**spk_0:** [26:01.67 - 26:02.99] Is that a sex ed program?

**spk_7:** [26:03.11 - 27:01.44] It's an abstinence education program.It's what we say is a straight abstinence program.That is,we do in fact cover the question of contraceptives,birth control,but we tell the kids the facts,the truth about the failure rates,the truth that in fact there's only one contraceptive that.Any claim to preventing,uh,AIDS or VD and that of course is the condom,but that failure rate is so,uh,incredible even for the prevention of,uh,pregnancy that when you relate it to,uh,the prevention of,uh,transfer of disease,the failure rate is likely to be more than 50 or 60%.So when we explain this to the young,uh,children,to the adolescents,they're listening.The main problem is that a lot of the educators,the adults,really do not have the faith or confidence that it can work with the children,

**spk_0:** [27:01.56 - 27:02.27] but you believe it

**spk_7:** [27:02.27 - 27:18.96] does work.We have the,the statistics now to prove that it does.We're,uh,at this point,we've tabulated over 8000 students over the four years,and as I said,every single school has shown positive attitudinal improvement.Kathleen,

**spk_0:** [30:06.21 - 30:21.29] Yes,Kathleen,when we talk about sex ed in the school.We are told by the so-called experts that you cannot teach them abstinence because they're already sexually active.It's just 19th century stuff to teach them abstinence.Now,what is your experience?

**spk_7:** [30:21.49 - 31:54.24] Well,we have found that's not true at all.Uh,among,uh,the schools that we have dealt with,and we have,uh,26 schools in the federal pilot and 52 funded by the state of Illinois.We have found that the vast majority of uh adolescents today are very anxious to know how they can be healthy.For instance,we've asked them,Do you think sexual urges are controllable?And from the before test to the after we double.It's over 100%.And I would like to point out some of the schools we're tabulating now.Uh,they,it jumped from 30% before to 54% afterwards.It said it was always controllable,but two schools that we did yesterday,another one of the four choices we give them for an answer to this question is that they would say no,never,uh,they're never controllable.In two of the schools,it went from 6% before to zero afterwards and another choice is I don't know that went from 15% to 0 afterwards.So that if after the program here we didn't have.Any,uh,kids in a school,like there were almost 300 in the school who said they didn't know that they were controllable or that said they were never controllable,and I think this is extremely hopeful that if we just bring out to these young people.How they can control their sexual feelings and use them at the appropriate time,they are willing to do it.

**spk_0:** [31:54.64 - 32:08.54] It's pretty clear from what you said that you are talking about these courses in the public schools,your course Project Respect.Uh,haven't you run into any of these,uh,so-called church and state problems of imposing your values on other people's children?

**spk_7:** [32:09.06 - 33:00.61] Well,that's.What,uh,some of the Planned Parenthood people are trying to say.However,we tell people just stop and think.Just because teaching good health happens to agree with a religious tenet,happens to coincide with it,is no reason not to teach good health.After all,the government funds and promotes,and our public schools promote the teaching of charity.Feed the poor.The sick and the hungry are all religious tenets.They are charity.So if we can do that for the good of society,we certainly in this day of,and,uh,of AIDS and all the trauma connected with teen promiscuity,we ought to be teaching them good,healthy habits.And our statistics are showing,and I would be very happy to provide to you.Uh,the reports and our statistics to send to your listeners.

**spk_0:** [33:00.89 - 33:10.49] Well,if you'll provide that to us,uh,Kathleen,we'll put it in our sex education packet which is available to those who send a contribution,uh,for this program.So thank you one

**spk_7:** [33:10.49 - 33:57.52] other thing I'd like to,uh,add to the reference to comprehensive sex that we are finding a lot of people are reporting there is a very definite emphasis to promoting masturbation.And this is one of those areas,as you mentioned earlier,that is not very comfortable to talk about.However,what we find is dangerous here is that the young people are being given the impression that sex and love does not necessarily depend on sharing it with anybody.All you need is yourself,and I think this is a terribly dangerous thinking to put in the minds of young people.It's really developing selfishness.And a complete wrong impression of what sex ought to be.

**spk_0:** [33:57.90 - 34:05.41] Well,if you'll provide us with a flyer or some material from your program,we'll be happy to include it in our packet.Thank you very much for calling,Kathleen.

**spk_1:** [34:05.54 - 34:08.34] And in Indianapolis,here's Joan Phyllis.Hello,

**spk_0:** [34:08.46 - 34:09.62] Joan.Hello,Phyllis.

**spk_8:** [34:10.30 - 34:11.94] I'm delighted that you now have this

**spk_0:** [34:11.94 - 34:16.34] program.Well,thank you.And what is your experience with sex education?Well,

**spk_8:** [34:16.48 - 35:20.49] uh,last year,We were very successful in the state of Indiana in passing a,uh,quite important bill.I think the,uh,main thrust of the bill is that if sex education is going to be taught or AIDS education,which has been mandated by state law in the state of Indiana as it has been in many other states,or education on any other sexually transmitted diseases.Then throughout that education,abstinence must be the expected standard,and I'm stressing two phrases there,the word throughout and the phrase expected standard.In other words,you cannot just drop abstinence in as many Planned Parenthood and other sex education curriculums do.The best way to not become pregnant or contract a sexually transmitted disease is to abstain,however,and then all of the emphasis is on the however,in other words,the contraceptive methods.

**spk_0:** [35:20.60 - 35:30.74] Well,I saw some sex ed programs where they said,in effect,it's all right to be abstinent if you really want to,but then And they move right along into telling them all about all the contraceptive patronizing.

**spk_8:** [35:32.79 - 36:09.25] So if you with the word throughout,what we are looking for is the,uh,sex education curriculum.If it is taught,and it has not been mandated to be taught in Indiana,if it is taught that throughout,whether you start in the 8th grade or kindergarten,they must,uh,teach the expectation.Of abstinence.Now that word expectation is very important if you are expecting the children to abstain.Then for instance,there is no excuse whatsoever for teaching contraceptive methods because that's a double message.Well,um,

**spk_0:** [36:09.50 - 36:20.05] the expectation of most of the courses over the last 15 years,at least the ones that I've examined,is that the children are going to be sexually active.I,I think that's a fair statement that

**spk_8:** [36:26.97 - 37:03.81] that is their expectation.Is this the late 1960s.And uh you are absolutely right what you are saying now.uh,we did have a great deal of pressure,uh,to not pass the bill from Planned Parenthood and other social agencies that are making their livelihood out of,uh,uh,sexually active teens.And however,the legislators,some from a very good moral point of view,others from the concern with the sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS that can kill,we did pass it and we passed it handily.

**spk_0:** [37:04.03 - 37:12.12] Well,thank you very much for telling us that success story,and if you'll give us a copy of that bill,we'll include it in our.Sex education packet.Be glad to.Thank you,Joan,

**spk_1:** [37:12.17 - 37:18.17] and thank you for the call.Lively conversation today,Phyllis.We move on to Port Washington,New York.Here's Liz.Hello,

**spk_0:** [37:18.27 - 37:21.89] Liz.Hi P Phyllis.What are you?What's your experience with sex education?

**spk_8:** [37:22.45 - 38:16.60] Well,I live in Nassau County and we have a community college here which has been in our New York press,and is that on Long Island?It's on Long Island.That's correct.Um,and they have a,uh,course titled,um,Family Life and Human Sexuality.And,uh,on investigation of the text,uh,it was found the,the pictures were,uh,pornographic in nature,and the values that were,uh,being suggested,uh,were certainly not traditional values,and,uh,we were fortunate enough to get,um,the material from the text to a journalist in New York City,Ray Harrison,who works for the New York Post,and he,he ran an article or two.He's done many more since then.Uh,about this course,uh,which was helpful to us because it brought,brought,uh,to the attention of those people in the metropolitan area,uh,the nature of the course.People just didn't seem to know what it was.

**spk_0:** [38:17.21 - 38:18.81] Pardon,what was the nature of the course?

**spk_8:** [38:19.17 - 38:47.65] Well,the nature of the course is,uh,well,let me give you a,a couple of,um,of the suggested assignments that were on the assignment sheet.Uh,this is something that you can do,uh,that you might not otherwise do was the statement,uh,uh,from the school,uh,such as visiting a gay bar or to interview a prostitute or to go to a nude beach.Now these,well,that's the title of their course and stand by,

**spk_0:** [38:47.68 - 38:51.91] Liz.We have to break.For announcements,we'd like to hear some more of those assignments from this course.

**spk_1:** [38:52.11 - 39:10.07] Don't go away,Liz,and you don't go away because this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.In fact,if you'd like to jump in on the conversation,we're at 1-800-736-3202.Jot that number down because if you don't get in next week,you'll want to get in next week.And this is P Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_5:** [39:13.76 - 40:08.05] The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,a place where the most powerful man in the world resides,the president of the United States.But what many Americans don't know is that some of our nation's most important decisions aren't made in the Oval Office,because according to the Constitution,the power to make laws was granted only to Congress and not to the president.That's why only Congress can declare war.Raise and support armies and approve treaties.The bill is passed.The Constitution,the words we live by.To receive a free copy of this great document and information about it,write Constitution,Washington DC 200063999.A message from the commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution and the Advertising Council.

**spk_9:** [40:10.09 - 40:56.67] From the east to the west we're standing proud.From the north to the south we're standing proud Our Constitution is still standing.Standing.Constitution is still.2 Kept us people Can eagle soaring high above.Constitution is still

**spk_0:** [41:28.68 - 41:35.72] New York and Liz was telling us some of the assignments in this so-called family living course in a community college in Long Island.Liz,

**spk_8:** [41:36.12 - 42:33.48] yes,um.Aside from the assignments which are outside the parameters of what we consider to be traditional behavior that were,uh,on the assignment sheet,the textbook and its pornographic pictures,uh,were a shock to,uh,everyone who saw them.But thirdly,uh,there were also,uh,as part of the course materials,a film,a Swedish film called Sexual Intercourse,plus slides.Now the film,uh,the public is not allowed to see the film.The,the film is only,uh,for the students who are taking the course,so the issue that has arisen on this controversial course has been public access.And we are at the point,and hopefully this week we'll be filing papers,uh,to initiate a court action in order to have,um,a decision as to whether or not the people of Nassau County have the right to see the materials that are being used in a court that is paid for with tax dollars,both county dollars and state dollars.Well,

**spk_0:** [42:33.52 - 42:33.76] I don't

**spk_8:** [42:33.76 - 42:33.88] know

**spk_0:** [42:33.88 - 42:44.31] about you,but I think that anything that's paid for by our Tax money should be available for inspection by the public unless it's a secret,uh,classified information to do with national security.

**spk_8:** [42:44.60 - 43:27.50] Well,it's interesting that every one of the appointees to the board of trustees of Nassau Community College that were appointed by Governor Cuomo are opposed to public access.We've been very fortunate with one of the new appointees who was an appointee of the local county executive.Uh,who,uh,has gone on record in opposition to this course and in favor of public access.He,as a member of the board is concerned that there might be a liability factor for himself as a member of that board and the board as a,uh,as a unit,uh,itself.And so he is,he is trying to protect his interest and he has now split the board,uh,in terms of we have 4 who are.Public access and the others are opposed.Well,

**spk_0:** [43:27.58 - 43:32.47] thank you,Liz,and call back one of these days and tell us how your lawsuit is progressing.We will.

**spk_1:** [43:32.95 - 43:41.24] Jan in O'Fallon,Illinois over KSIV radio and incidentally we're broadcasting from the facilities of KSIV.Hello Jan.

**spk_0:** [43:41.55 - 43:44.47] Hi.Have you had a sex education problem?Well,

**spk_3:** [43:44.58 - 43:58.01] I would just want to alert parents that it's not just in sex education classes.There's a course here called social issues,and they teach,uh,abortion.They teach suicide.They teach homosexuality,and it's supposedly a history

**spk_0:** [43:58.01 - 44:01.51] class.Is this in the public schools?And what grade is it?

**spk_3:** [44:03.40 - 44:04.57] Freshman and sophomore.

**spk_0:** [44:05.38 - 44:13.30] And they call abortion and euthanasia and suicide.These are social issues or maybe current events.No,it's called social,

**spk_8:** [44:13.61 - 44:15.25] social issues,social issues,

**spk_3:** [44:15.30 - 44:18.88] and it is,uh,under a history department,

**spk_0:** [44:19.19 - 44:21.90] and I suppose it's taught in a value neutral way.

**spk_3:** [44:22.31 - 44:33.24] Absolutely.There's no textbook.You cannot go in and review,um,the textbook because they don't have any.They have guest speakers.They don't know,do not know who those guest speakers will be,and so you cannot,um.

**spk_0:** [44:34.06 - 44:51.28] The parent the parent cannot inspect or review the course before the child takes it,and this is a course for credit in the high school.Well,that's another lesson for parents to be on guard.You ought to find out what's going on and what courses your child is taking.That's right.And just not in the

**spk_3:** [44:51.28 - 44:52.31] in the health department.

**spk_0:** [44:53.56 - 44:55.23] Well,thank you very much for calling,Jan.Let's squeeze

**spk_1:** [44:55.23 - 44:58.87] in another telephone call.It's Elaine in Saint Louis.Hi Elaine.

**spk_0:** [44:59.08 - 44:59.68] Hello Elaine.

**spk_8:** [45:00.19 - 45:58.55] Um,I don't have a particular personal experience to share,but it's just sort of an observation as having.Been somewhat involved off and on through the years having put kids through school and all on and any sex education matters and listening to your callers,the observation is that,um,all the time and energy that has to be expended by the,the poor distraught parents who are fighting these things and by the administrators and teachers who are pushing it,if they'd spend that time and energy on.Teaching what they're supposed to teach,we'd really be producing some terrific,uh,literate kids coming out of the schools.And,and then secondly,the observation that it's like the administrators and the teachers are saying to the parents,OK,parents,you just keep coughing up the tax money,the money to pay these bills,but we are not going to let you have anything to say about what you're getting for your money.Just keep providing the money.

**spk_0:** [46:00.15 - 47:07.40] Well,thank you very much for that comment,Elaine.Uh,if listeners will write in for our packet on sex education,one of the most important things in it is a remarkable new speech by the former Undersecretary of Education Linus Wright on how parents can deal with the problem of sex education in the schools,and it's a,it's an article that is very encouraging to parents.It tells you specifically how to deal with the principals.Deal with the superintendent,deal with the teacher,and deal with the school board,and he comes at it from the point of view that the public school has no business deliberately encouraging students to adopt a different set of morals from their parents.It,uh,teaches parents how to evaluate the program and,uh,does the program encourage the child to engage in sexual intercourse or to practice abstinence?Uh,does it violate community standards of taste and decency?Uh,does it present,uh,traditional and permissive viewpoints,uh,in,uh,detail in comparable detail and sympathy and so forth.So,uh,we appreciate your call.I hope you'll encourage parents in your area to look into what's going on.

**spk_1:** [47:08.00 - 47:24.24] And the sex packet that you just spoke of is available if you send in a $10 contribution to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.How long ago in the brief time that we have left,did we begin teaching sex ed in The public schools at

**spk_0:** [47:24.24 - 47:25.54] least 15 years ago.

**spk_1:** [47:25.76 - 47:28.72] Why did it start then,uh,for all times?Well,

**spk_0:** [47:28.80 - 47:56.56] it started then because it came in along with the whole era of sexual liberation,ah,permissiveness,the breakdown in community standards on television.And,ah,all of the easy sex and pornography that were promoted so generally,sex education came in.However,it was experimental.It wasn't everywhere.But in those places,uh,where it was like,ah,California,ah,they developed the highest rates of promiscuity and pregnancy.

**spk_1:** [47:56.71 - 48:01.67] And that's Phyllis-Schlafly.This is P Phyllis-Schlafly live on the USA Radio Network.
