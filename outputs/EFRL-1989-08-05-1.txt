**spk_0:** [00:01.81 - 02:15.46] Passed a new law mandating a suicide curriculum for use in the public schools.Do you want your children taught in school about suicide?Welcome to Philly Schlafly Live.This week a subject no one really likes to talk about,but nonetheless one which we need to discuss suicide and how it's dealt with in the public school classrooms.Of course,your input will be welcomed and we'll be looking forward to hearing from you at 1-8000.It's 736-3202.If you try in and the line's busy,of course,try back again.Our toll-free number from anywhere in America 1-800-736-3202.I'm Bruce Hayes.Last week on P Phyllis-Schlafly Live,we talked about death education.When our time ran out and we had to cut off numerous telephone calls,we were starting to get inquiries about suicide education.So today's program is a natural follow up.A survey funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services found that 1 of every 7 teenagers has attempted suicide.Phyllis,are the public schools actually putting in a course called suicide education to combat the problem?Illinois is trying to put it into the public schools,and we've encountered this in a number of states around the country.Usually it's part of the health curriculum.Suicide isn't very healthy,as you can imagine.Our guest today is Dr.Alan Carlson,who's president of the Rockford Institute,a research center on family and social concerns.And from Rockford,Illinois,we have Dr.Alan Carlson on the line.Hello,Dr.Carlson.Hello,Phyllis,how are you?Dr.Carlson's not only President of the Rockford Institute,but he's a Reagan appointee to the National Commission on Children.He received his doctorate from Ohio University and he's written extensively on modern social history,family policy,and the interaction between economics,culture,and religion.One of the subjects you've written about,Alan,is adolescent suicide.Is it just that we hear more about teenage suicide today,or do you think it's true that the suicide rate of teenagers has risen dramatically?

**spk_1:** [02:16.46 - 02:59.76] Well,on the one hand,we,we're seeing a what might be called a phony elevation of the problem of youth suicide.On the other hand,ah,there's,I think,a complete misunderstanding of the real causes that lie behind the problem that does exist.Ah,briefly,uh,between 1960 and 1977,there was a very dramatic increase in the youth suicide rate,um.And it went up quite dramatically,uh,several times over,but since 1977,the rate has actually gone down somewhat.Ah,and the US rate,uh,suicide rate for young people,ah,is well below that of several West European countries which are much like us in other ways.

**spk_0:** [03:00.18 - 03:06.85] Well,nevertheless,the push has come since 1977 to put a suicide course in the schools.

**spk_1:** [03:07.26 - 03:30.80] Well,uh,you know,if you look and see who's really pushing for these curricula,you find some,uh,some interesting things.Uh,it's groups such as the American Association of Suicidology,the American Psychological Association.The National Education Association,all groups with a strong vested interest in,uh,expanding,uh,funding for these kinds of programs.

**spk_0:** [03:30.89 - 03:31.48] You mean it'll make more

**spk_1:** [03:31.48 - 03:32.60] jobs for people.

**spk_0:** [03:32.83 - 03:35.47] That's what I was going to say,more jobs for their members.

**spk_1:** [03:35.83 - 04:09.34] Oh,and very much so,and you'll find them elevating the,uh,the number of,of,of,of,of children who are actually threatened.Uh,they'll,they'll say things like children desperately want to know about suicide.Well,that's true.Children want to know about just about anything in the world.Uh,and what,what in fact is happening is we're seeing them tear down certain taboos,uh,certain social.Assumptions about that there are certain things we don't talk about,certainly not at schools,but tearing those down in a sense to open up new opportunities.

**spk_0:** [04:09.50 - 04:14.40] Well,do you think it's better that we don't talk about suicide in a classroom discussion?

**spk_1:** [04:15.69 - 05:33.84] I would think not,and I,and I say that because I think we,we miss the real sources of the,even the increase that did take place between 1960 and 1977.There's been some fascinating research done on that,uh,which shows that you can almost explain all of that,that massive increase for three reasons rise in the divorce rate.The rise in the percentage of mothers who've entered the workforce and who consequently aren't at home when their children come home from school,for example,and finally and perhaps most importantly,the decline in the percentage of young people who go to church,um.Interesting work done by Steven Stack at Auburn University and Rodney Stark at Washington University would show that these three factors explain almost entirely the increase in youth suicide.Uh,what's interesting about that is that,uh,if,if that is indeed the fact,then what are the solutions we should be looking towards?Well,it's getting children back in church,uh.Ah,it's,ah,finding ways of giving,of,of helping mothers stay at home when their children need them.Ah,it's finding ways of,uh,repairing marriages rather than turning toward divorce.These are not the things that are being talked about in suicide prevention programs.

**spk_0:** [05:34.20 - 05:59.66] No,they want to talk about having a discussion in the classroom,seeing films,and,and counseling the people who've had the suicide experience.I attended a conference on suicide education a couple of years ago,and there was nothing in the whole weekend directed toward prevention.It was all toward expanding the social service bureaucracy to counsel those who had had something to do with it.

**spk_1:** [06:00.16 - 06:20.35] Well,that's,ah,that's a fairly standard story,as you know,the,ah,ah,ignoring the true social causes of a problem,which usually involve the breakdown of a traditional system and instead looking towards,ah,the therapy and state,state paid therapists to provide the,uh,to provide the solution.

**spk_0:** [06:20.60 - 06:29.37] Do you think the biggest correlation between suicidal teenagers and anything else is,uh,attendance or non-attendance in church?

**spk_1:** [06:29.94 - 07:10.29] That's what the numbers suggest.Ah,one fascinating finding by,uh,by,uh,the sociologist,uh,Steven Stack was that if we could increase youth attendance in church by 1%.We would see a 1.5% decrease in the youth suicide rate.That's a,you know,an amazing negative relationship.And,uh,if we could increase youth attendance in church by 5%,uh,we would see,uh,uh,7.5 to 8% decrease in youth suicide.An amazingly positive preventive program there,but it's one again you never hear about.

**spk_0:** [07:10.49 - 07:15.72] Is that correlation true for all the subgroups such as whites and blacks,boys and girls?

**spk_1:** [07:15.81 - 07:25.21] It's true for all subgroups.That's right.It's it's,it was again focusing specifically on young people in their teens.True for all races and age categories.

**spk_0:** [07:25.45 - 08:01.60] Well,we're constantly told by the media that the Ozzie and Harriet family is dead,that different kinds of families are the wave of the future.That our nation is increasingly secular and that most children will live parts of their lives with only one parent and all these other signs of social change.Now,do we just have to accept this and decide we're going to commiserate with those who are suicidal,or can we try to Attack the problem itself,which is the loss of of church membership and the decline in the numbers of intact families.

**spk_1:** [08:02.00 - 09:24.62] Well,certainly there's little the government can do to encourage church attendance,and it shouldn't even try,but old fashioned evangelism.is to my mind the greatest source of for positive social work that can be done.That doesn't mean that that means simply going out and drawing your neighbors and unchurched friends back into,uh,into a church life,um.Sure,we can do that,um.Is the,is the,the traditional family dead?Uh,no,it's not,and the statistics show that it's not.It is certainly true that,uh,more women,more mothers are in the workforce now than ever before,but I think there are things we can do.To,uh,reduce the tax burden falling on traditional families,which would reduce some of the pressure on mothers to go to work,there are things we can do to increase the social esteem that,uh,mothers at home,uh,should receive but currently don't.Um,there's a great number of things that can be done to,uh,help turn around the pressures.Uh,and indeed even the 1980s has shown they lessened to some degree.That's why the youth suicide rate stabilized.Church attendance by youth declined in the 1960s and 1970s,but it stabilized in the 1980s,and,uh,we just need to turn that number around.

**spk_0:** [09:25.10 - 09:32.50] And you feel that the teenage suicide does correlate definitely with the factor of the mother being out of the home and in the labor force.

**spk_1:** [09:32.75 - 09:42.62] There's no question that that's one aspect of it.Uh,like I say,some of the research work done recently makes it abundantly clear that that's a very definite factor.

**spk_0:** [09:43.64 - 09:56.39] You're a historian,and I'll bet you're familiar with Alexis de Tocqueville's comments on American society and on the place of religion in it.Uh,do you think if he came back today,he would,uh,uh,make some of the same comments?

**spk_1:** [09:57.53 - 10:57.39] Well,I think he would,ah,see some things that are the same and some that are different.Ah,the things that are the same is still at the popular level,a deep attachment to,ah,to religion and religious belief,and,ah,great involvement in churches.The United States,uh,still sees about 40% of its population attending church or synagogue in a given weekend.That compares with like 2 or 3% in most European countries.Um,on the other hand,I think he would be,uh,appalled at to the degree to which religious belief,uh,is no longer discussed at the political level or,or in the level of intellectual society,the degree to which,uh,religious,uh,Teaching and religious belief is not even considered important anymore by key thinkers and leading intellectuals,the degree to which we've driven religion out of public life,uh,in our newspapers and in our politics,that I think he would find appalling.

**spk_0:** [10:58.06 - 11:48.60] Do you have an opinion about the use of the Shakespearean play Romeo and Juliet in high schools,which is one of the 10 most widely used pieces of literature in high schools.When I went to high school,we read Hamlet,Macbeth,Julius Caesar,and others.We did not read Romeo and Juliet,but Romeo and Juliet has become very trendy to use in the high schools,and very frequently they don't read it at all.They just see the movie and um.Many people believe that the use of this movie in the high schools tends to glamorize teenage suicide and to foster the notion that when teenagers commit suicide,they really do make their parents very unhappy,which seems to be one of the purposes.

**spk_1:** [11:49.71 - 12:49.06] I think,um,well,I wouldn't call for the,you know,the censorship of the film,um,uh,in a,in a broad sense,I think it's first of all inappropriate to teach great literature through movies.Uh,if one is going to use the play,one should read it,um,but more,but more precisely to your point,um,uh,certainly I think,uh,that film,um,and given the,uh,the very attractive nature of the,of the,of the actors who play the parts in that film.It's,um,I think a very bad influence,um,on very impressionable young people,and I would avoid it.Uh,that'd be my advice.I think,um,uh,if it's handled properly by a,a good literature teacher,I think you could,you could handle it probably OK,but clearly using the film,um,particularly if it's tied in in any way,even by suggestion to suicide education.Ah,would have an extremely negative effect on children.

**spk_0:** [12:49.84 - 13:10.72] Um,but as you point out,when,when parents have objected to it,they are accused of being censored,and most of the cases we've investigated,uh,they,they really were not objecting to the Shakespearean play.They were objecting to the movie which contains a new,a nude scene.It seems to me that showing a movie in a literature class is a real cop out.Well,

**spk_1:** [13:10.81 - 13:30.70] I agree with that,and,uh,of course,anytime you raise a protest about that,you're going to face charges of,well,that's censorship.Well,and you just have to press ahead and,ah,say no,it's not censorship,it's,uh,what's,what's,what's a decent education for children of this age.Um,uh,and,uh,

**spk_0:** [13:31.08 - 13:51.14] do you have any suggestions for parents when,uh,they are confronted with the having of a segment of their health course on suicide education and on discussing it,uh,which really takes away some of the taboos that we have discussed earlier.

**spk_1:** [13:52.49 - 14:37.02] Well,I would,um,um.Encourage them to put pressure and indeed political pressure,um,finally on school boards which do have the right and authority to control curricula to some degree at least,uh,on state politicians in those states where there are central,uh,textbook selection committees and that sort of thing,um,I think elected politicians will respond to pressure.I think,uh,local school administrators by and large are not going to be terribly responsive.They are part of the,the educational establishment.I would put pressure where it counts is on those people who have to stand for election and force them to do their jobs.

**spk_0:** [14:37.15 - 15:04.74] Well,thank you very much,Alan Carlson of the Rockford Institute.We appreciate your joining.Us today and if you just joined us,we're talking about suicide and how it's dealt with in the public school classrooms.And from anywhere in America,if you'd like to participate in our discussion,we welcome your questions and comments.1-800-736-3202.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_2:** [15:11.81 - 17:12.07] A national panel reported that 25% of 17-year-olds are functional illiterates.Another 40% are marginal illiterates.That means nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science.What have they been doing all those years in public schools?Sex education,death education,new age meditation,and other non-academic psychological activities.This can be stopped.US law gives you,the parents,primary control over your children's education.Find out about your rights.Read the Education Reporter.It's a monthly newspaper from Eagle-Forum.The education reporter keeps you informed about offensive school curricula and about victories won by parents who assert their rights.Write for a free sample of the education reporter.The address Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.From the east to the west we're standing.From the north to the south we're standing.Oh To the factories.Our Constitution is still standing.200 Kept us eagle soaring high above I shall be.From Eagle-Forum in

**spk_0:** [17:14.39 - 29:06.53] on the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.The reason we're talking about suicide education is that we've had so many complaints from parents at our parents advisory center.Some of their students have been asked to write a suicide note.Some were given a list of 10 ways to die and asked to select the ways that they found more agreeable than other ways.Some were asked to select what reasons they might consider to be valid for committing suicide.What a morbid,very morbid and depressing.You should,we'll have to have another program sometime on some of these questionnaires that ask children questions about suicide and depression.We've got with us on the line now from Perry,Florida,Mrs.Gaille Dickert,who served on the youth suicide prevention task force of the state of Florida for 3 years.This task force was charged with the responsibility of developing materials for training teachers in suicide prevention.And then their guide for trainers was sent to all Florida school districts,and Mrs.Gaille Dickert is on the line from Perry,Florida.Hello Gail.Phyllis.Thank you for joining us.Thank you.Uh,what do you think is or should be the main point in training teachers to deal with suicide prevention?Well,teachers have the opportunity to,um,observe students' behavior often more waking hours even than their than parents,um,perhaps parents who work as Doctor Carlson pointed out,and if they and and parents are appropriately trained to recognize the signs of severe emotional distress or drug use,often these signs are the same,um,then.And then they can learn appropriate steps to take in time and young lives can be saved.You mean such as contacting the parents.Um,that's number one in our program that we developed in Florida is that you would,if you,when you note the signs of distress,that you would notify the parents,make an appointment to talk with them immediately,and um,well,what do you think about talking about suicide or using that word?Is that a plus or a minus?Well,we feel in Florida that the best programs,the best suicide prevention programs are simple and direct,and they don't dwell on the topic of suicide.They let young people,most of whom are inexperienced in dealing with crises,um,know that we all have painful times in our lives,times of rejection,humiliation,or loss,and the best programs reassure young people that help is available for those times,and they give information on how to seek help.They teach the dangers of alcohol and other drug use,which though Dr.Carlson didn't mention the alcohol and other drug use.You feel there's a high correlation there.Well,what we feel is that this is the main contributing factor to youth suicide.Over 50% of the young people who have used alcohol and other drugs.Over 50% of the young people who commit suicide have used alcohol and other drugs,and we feel this is a main contributing factor,and um Well,on your task force,did you have a hard time convincing people that it was better not to talk about suicide?Well,we found that um the negative approach was deeply ingrained in education programs,the,uh,that they seemed to feel that just talking about suicide was prevention,just like in the early drug programs in the 70s and early 80s,they felt that um just talking about drugs and showing them how to use them.Um,was the answer,but what we found with drug programs was that only increased the use and has developed a really terrible problem in our nation that wasn't the only thing that developed the drug problem,but it was not a helpful way.And I think now the education people are seeing the benefit of turning that around and offering.Really prevention instead of of awareness type programs,um,teaching young people positive ways to deal with their problems,teaching them about uh exercise to deal with stress.Uh,teaching them um that help is available and just to reach out for help whenever you have a problem rather than dwelling on the topic of suicide.I,I assume you put,uh,I assume you put all of those positive things in your training guide that was sent out to teachers.Did your guide also include warning teachers about subjects and techniques that they should not use in the classroom?Uh,in the,uh,there's an important statement in the foreword which states that the materials in the training guide should not be used as a stimulus for research projects,nor for attitude surveys about death,suicide,personal feelings,family problems,sexual preferences,or other attitudes.It warns also,um,in the materials for the,for the children that,um,that,um.There can be possible negative effects from films on suicide or the use of suicide poems and stories.It warns against having young people role play suicidal situations.Uh,it also makes it clear that students should not be required to divulge personal problems in front of others in the classroom,and it gives suggestions for how to handle a situation where a student might spontaneously disclose a problem.Well,why do,why do you think all that personal disclosure in the classroom is bad?Some people would argue that that's how the teacher can identify a problem with the pupil.Well,even when a psychologist is working with a person,whether they are a young person or an adult,they take a time and on a 1 to 1 basis before expecting disclosure,and um.When often whenever a problem is brought up in front of peers,the child may be ostracized in front of others,might be talked about,might be teased.Children are children can be very cruel to each other.Children,children can be cruel to each other,and,um,well,but Gaille,don't you think that some of these techniques that you think are bad and which in your guide you told the teachers were bad.Are not very typically used in curricula across the country.We,we have complaints from parents all the time about these privacy invading questionnaires that ask the children such depressing questions.If I had to answer all those depressing questions about whether I had tried suicide and what were the bad things of the day and,and what were the real downers in my life,I'd be a nervous wreck.I think the,uh,questionnaires are some of the worst,um,uh,materials that I have seen.Um,I think they're absolutely terrible.I think they're dangerous to use.Um,ironically,the reason that they often give for using these.is to uh pick up on suicidal ideation in the young people.In my,in my opinion they do just the opposite.They have the potential for giving healthy young minds,uh,giving them suicidal ideation,and I,I think we warned against that in our state of Florida in a newsletter which went out from our prevention center there was,uh,not a warning but a recommendation that these not these types of materials not be used,but you must understand that there are,uh,testing companies that see this as a very lucrative business.These tests are very expensive if you order them,um,they are.Well,they're very widely,they're very widely used.We're getting complaints about these questionnaires all the time.I think that they're absolutely terrible.The people who are producing these send them out.They give you a little warning whenever they mail them to you and you.Paid for them that they must not be reproduced that so that you would have to order them from these companies.They're very expensive and they're making a great deal of money on this.This is a lucrative field.Psychiatric hospitals are making their bundle of money on this by having ads on TV that say if you're a young person they list all these signs,you know,um,if that perhaps they should be institutionalized.Um,well,I hope,I hope some of our,uh,uh,listeners will call in with their own experiences in this field because this is very widespread.Uh,Gaille,you are not a,uh,a,a state employee or a Department of Education employee.You were a volunteer who spent 3 years donating your time to this project.Uh,what motivated you to give so much of your own personal time to make this a good teaching guide for the state of Florida?Well,in 1982,I had just begun to teach in the public schools myself.Um,I might say in response to something that Dr.Carlson said,um,I was a mother of three children.I finished my college education at age 42 by taking courses,um,at night and whenever I could,um,so that I would be home with my children.I was always home in the afternoon.My son,who died at age 16 in 1982,was an acolyte in our church.He was a very faithful young man.He was bright.He was loved.We were a family who did things together all the time.We had a beautiful family.I might say that,my friends who are survivors that I know who've lost their children,they were very fine Christian people.Their children also attended church.But something happened in the classroom.Well,he,yes,he had a humiliating problem.He was a young man who had not dealt with,dealt with a severe crisis before in his life,and he had a very serious and embarrassing situation happen to him at school,which I did not hear about until after his death.Well,we don't need for you to tell us about that,but it did have an unhappy ending,I understand,and Uh,we,uh,commend you for giving of your expertise to tell other people how the wrong thing can be said in the classroom and what are the right things to be said,and you were pretty well satisfied with the teaching guide that your task force put out,right?Well,we worked for 3 years,um,on the program after legislation,but after cleaning it up for 3 years,you were pretty well satisfied.Oh,it,it was,it was a difficult process to get everyone to agree on,um,on the positive,all the positive things that we,we came up with,but there were,there were wonderful contributions by,by different people,and it,I feel that it is the best,uh,teaching guide in the,well,thank,thank you,Gaille.We're out of time and we thank you for sharing this experience with us and your expertise,and we

**spk_0:** [30:11.59 - 32:17.41] On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and this week we're talking about suicide and how the public schools deal with the subject.Now,what about you?Have you dealt with the problem from experience,perhaps maybe in your own family?How do you feel about public schools addressing the issue?Uh,do you have a solution?And uh what are your thoughts on what you've heard?we welcome your telephone calls at 1-800-736-3202 on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.And remember on this program,we're not discussing the whole social problem of suicide.We're discussing how it's dealt with in the public school classroom.And the first I ever heard about that was in the hearings conducted by the Department of Education in 1984 when one parent came in and said that her child had been assigned to write a suicide note.And the class was given a sample note,and it read like this,I am finally going to do it.Unemployment drives me crazy.Inflation makes me angry.The cost of living turns my stomach.Big business raises the cost of candy and gum.Teachers expect too much.School takes away my freedom.I can't communicate with my parents.My parents don't understand me.I have said my goodbyes.I fought a good fight,but I have met defeat.So can you imagine?I can't,I can't.So in other words,the public Schools are actually saying,what would you do if you had to commit suicide and why write a letter on it?Write a sample suicide note,and they call this a sample writing exercise.Another parent came in and said that her,her 7th grade child was asked the question,What reasons would motivate you to commit suicide?And then they gave her a multiple choice question with all these answers,and she could select which reasons might motivate her to commit suicide.So let's hear what our listeners have to say.Let's go to 1-800-736-3202 with the Uling station KSIV in St.Louis.Here's Larry.Hello,Larry.Uh,Phyllis,I don't know whether this has been covered before.I just tuned in,

**spk_1:** [32:17.82 - 32:24.54] but are there any statistics indicating an increase in suicides or suicidal tendencies?

**spk_0:** [32:25.73 - 37:46.74] Our first eliminated.Oh,our first caller,our first guest today,Dr.Alan Carlson,told very clearly that suicide rate of teenagers rose rather dramatically during the 1970s when there was a big falloff in church attendance and increase in the use of.Drugs,but,uh,teenage suicide has leveled off since then,and I don't know if you heard him or not,but he told of the very high correlation,or I guess you would say negative correlation between church attendance and teenage suicide.Uh,church membership is the biggest factor.Thank you for the telephone call.We move on to Lois.Here's Phyllis-Schlafly.Lois,he Lois.Yes,Phyllis,George Grant in his book Grand Illusions in one of the chapters called Selling Sex The Educational Scandal,talks about peer counseling,a situation in which 4 teenage girls that were not sexually active after being involved in their Peer counseling situation.Basically all one of the girls uh ended up committing suicide after having become pregnant and,and I'm wondering if this is all tied together too with school-based clinics and then if they have um.If they have the suicide education,say,in an English class,obviously when they,they get into a problem,then the immediate solution is suicide if they've been given that in classes.There has actually been some,um,some studying done as to whether or not this is almost intentional among the lower classes because it's,it comes out of the,the racist concept,uh.Of where we're putting the school-based clinics into the inner cities and so forth,and um well it it isn't just a race.I noticed that there was quite um quite an op ed piece in The New York Times this week about an 80 five-year-old woman who had announced that she was going to commit suicide and she talked about the,the high medical cost and the economics of caring for the elderly.And there is apparently a great drive to legitimize suicide,to remove the taboos about it,and,and to make it considered by young people to be a viable alternative.To keep them from being a burden on society.Um,I also have a,a more personal question.I met a young woman last,um,summer,a mother of a number of children,and her high school student had committed suicide,had been in a deaf education class in an English class in a relatively good school district.Um,what are the chances of getting the schools to listen to you in Missouri?Do you know?Now that's a problem everywhere there,uh,I think the first thing you have to do is find out what they are doing.Uh,I,I suspect that it is the minority of schools that have a segment on suicide education,uh,but if it's there,it's probably not good.And again we need for the parents to read the textbooks and to find out what they have in them that might be objectionable.The way that suicide is presented in the classroom,I'm convinced would be an offense against the First Amendment rights of most of us because they present it as a as a viable alternative.They don't tell them it's illegal,wrong,and bad.And shouldn't be done.So thank you very much for calling in,Louis.Here's Cora in Indianapolis,Indiana over at WXIR.Phyllis.Hello,Cora.Hello,Phyllis.All right,I just wanted to place a personal note to this.I myself had a brother and a sister who committed suicide.They both attempted suicide as teenagers,and then it happened later on in life.And there's a question about my sister's death,whether it was suicide or uh she was given drugs to kill her,but still the lifestyle was there and drugs did play a part,I believe.But I think that it's a personal thing that should be dealt with within the individual's family.I just can't imagine talking about this in a classroom.No,I can't either.I would call that group therapy by unlicensed psychologists,and what you have in any classroom is a certain number of students who may be angry at their parents for any,any reason.Didn't get the car Friday night or whatever,and they may be a little bit emotionally unstable and then suicide is presented as one way out and they might not have considered it otherwise.It's unbelievable.It really is that they would even consider talking about this when it's such a a Complex Subject and the teachers are not qualified to teach with teach it,and you have children in the same class who are in different emotional states.Well,thank you very much for sharing your experience with us,Cora.We're at

**spk_0:** [37:49.97 - 37:56.17] If you try in and the number's busy,of course,try back again.Here's Brian in Fort Walton,Florida.Phyllis.Hello,Brian.

**spk_1:** [37:56.36 - 37:57.04] Hello there.

**spk_0:** [37:57.92 - 37:59.42] What is your question or comment?

**spk_1:** [37:59.72 - 38:04.76] I was,I am a teen suicide.About a year ago I committed suicide.

**spk_0:** [38:05.46 - 38:07.25] You're alive and well now,it sounds like,

**spk_1:** [38:07.42 - 38:07.62] yes,

**spk_0:** [38:07.70 - 38:09.16] I am.What happened?

**spk_1:** [38:09.71 - 38:21.23] The friends,well,some friends on the outside of the family were very,very supportive.Of me as far as the counseling group at the hospital.That I went to

**spk_0:** [38:22.37 - 38:25.42] You mean you,uh,you attempted suicide and they saved you?

**spk_1:** [38:27.00 - 38:52.80] Well,I attempted suicide and got scared and called a friend of mine who's a counselor for the school system up where I live at.And He came with another friend from the welfare department or from the psycho or from the summit Center,which is a mental health facility.And took me to a hospital in Clarksburg.And took care of me there.

**spk_0:** [38:55.24 - 39:14.84] Well,I think we're glad that there are counselors and doctors and people who can help people who have a have a real problem and are confronted with suicidal tendencies.The thing that we find very objectionable is discussing it in the classroom.

**spk_1:** [39:15.11 - 39:16.82] Yes,I don't agree with it at all.

**spk_0:** [39:17.32 - 40:06.84] You think that would be bad to discuss it generally in the classroom.Well,thank you very much for your comment,and it's good to have that firsthand experience from someone who had attempted suicide,and you don't want to discuss it in the classroom with everybody else.You need some very personal counseling and help.Thank you very much.It helps a whole lot.Thank you very much,Brian.We appreciate that.Bye bye.And yet,Bruce,we've had at our parents advisory center.who have told us that their children spent an entire afternoon discussing suicide in the classroom.We are talking about suicide and how the public schools address the problem.We're at 1-800-736-3202,not one of the most pleasant subjects,but indeed a subject that we feel we need to deal with on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [42:15.56 - 49:47.89] Suicide and how the public schools are dealing with it.That's our topic on P Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Very quickly,if you'd like a cassette copy of this program,we request that you send us $5.Our address is Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.A lot of callers waiting to.Talk to you,Phyllis.So let's jump back to it at 1-800-736-3202.And back in St.Louis over KSIV.Hello,what is your question or comment?Hi,Phyllis.I have an article from the Education Reporter printed in March,and I thought you might be interested in commenting on it.Um,I'll read it for you.A hanging noose displayed in a high school health education classroom in Rockland,Maine was taken down after school board members brought it to the principal's attention.Citizens and parents saw the rope news hanging in the front of the classroom while attending political precinct committee meetings at the school on Saturday,Saturday,February 22nd.Also on display was a chart focusing on global suicide statistics.When questioned,a school health teacher said the purpose of the noose was nothing at all.Well,thank you for reminding me of that.I had almost forgotten that,but we did find that news item that came out of Maine,I believe,and when they had the political precinct meetings,they found this noose hanging from the ceiling in a public school classroom.Unfortunately we didn't get back in time to take a picture,but there's no question about it being there,and presumably it was part of the suicide education,which gives you an idea of what is being taught in the public schools.That's your publication,The Education Reporter,and if you'd like a copy of it and you would like to start subscribing to the Education Reporter,it's $25 annually.Again,our address we'll have it a little bit later on.Let's move on to Brownsville,New Jersey over WCHR and Lorraine.Hello Lorraine.What is your question or comment?I have a comment.I myself suffered from depression and I was in the mental health unit we have here in the Burlington County Memorial Hospital,and I was surprised at the number of children that were in there between the ages of 14 and 15,young,young girls and stuff,and young men that said the reason why they were in there was because they tried to commit suicide just because their parents didn't understand or it was just amazing and then to have it being taught in the schools is unbelievable because it gives the kids an idea.Well,that's what we think.It gives them ideas that they didn't have or it legitimizes certain ideas that they might have toyed around with.I noticed that the Wall Street Journal has had front page stories about the tremendous business that's grown up in putting teenagers in psychiatric centers.Um,I hope you had a satisfactory experience and they helped you,but the alarming thing is the number of teenagers who were in there.Did you have an opinion about,about how many of them were into sex or drugs,and that may have contributed to their depression?There was that it was one young man that's all that was in there for the drugs and alcohol,and the rest of the children were just,you know,upset with the way the family life was going,and,and it was just amazing to know that these kids have felt that these things were really that important to go and try to end their life before they even got a chance to grow up to know what life was about.One of the things that we find so alarming is the large number of depressing materials that are given to students in literature class.Seems to me that young people ought to be given hope and inspiration and told what a great life they can have if they get their act together.So,well,thank you very much for Lorraine for calling.And here's Kitty in St.Louis again over at KSIV.Hello Kitty,what is your question or comment?Hello,hello,Kitty.I'm not plugged in.Hello.Oh well,you're plugged into us,so what is your question or comment?I can only hear you over the radio.I'm not hearing you in my receiver.Oh,well,uh,you speak up and I'll speak up.OK.I have a different perspective.It,it's not about the educational aspect per se.It doesn't seem academic to me because I had very personal involvement with pedophiles as a child.I was a victim and this just smacks of their philosophy.Um,it's,it's,it's.It's horrible.Well,it is a dreadful thing to talk about,and but to see this and It,it's,it's such a strong parallel to,to the way pedophiles relate to children.Their dynamics is not just in the sexual area.It's in the area of demoralizing them and demoralizing their whole personality.And they get a very sick pleasure out of this.And to hear that this is in the school system.Other people,I guess,wouldn't be aware of this parallel,but since I was a victim,it's shocking to me.Well,thank you very much for telling us about that.Fortunately we don't have anything to do with pedophiles in the schools,we hope,but we do have a lot of discussion of depressing information.And here's Jan for Phyllis Shofly in O'Fallon,Illinois.Hello,Jan,what is your question or comment?Um,in O'Fallon,they have a,a social.A studies,uh,course it's called Social Issues that,uh,deals in suicide.In the 9th grade.And uh the guy who teaches it is a government teacher,has absolutely no background uh in psychology to teach this whatsoever.And they have no textbooks.And so whatever they choose to bring into the classroom,they bring it in.Well,thank you for calling that to our attention.It is a good reminder that these subjects can come into any subject,even social studies.It's also a problem for the teachers when there is no textbook for the for the parents to evaluate.And we thank you for bringing that to our attention.You should look into it further,Phyllis,before we take,we go to your closing comments,in summary,what do you think the best way to deal with this subject is,because the subject is a major one in America today.The parents have to find out what is going on,and they have to make it clear that that suicide is not something that should be taught taught or discussed in the classroom because it infringes on their First Amendment rights.Whether you can tolerate suicide is certainly a matter of your not only your belief but your religion,and to legitimize it in the public school classroom is a very,very awful thing to do.And that's basically the same thing we've talked about with sex education.You're bringing it to their attention,and as a result it's serving as the catalyst for lots of bad things that do occur in our society.It can do that and And of course suicide is even more final.Yes,and this is sure to be one of the fastest growing programs in America today.This week we dealt with a subject that we don't like to deal with but felt we had to,that's suicide and how the public schools are dealing with it now.Keep in mind your notes.He is a yes vote to keep parents' rights and education going.It's Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we encourage you to write us.Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_0:** [51:51.14 - 52:51.47] Here are some excerpts from letters we received at our Eagle-Forum Parents Advisory Center.My son committed suicide as a result of involvement with Dungeons and Dragons played in the talented and gifted class at school.My daughter was required to fill out a questionnaire in which she was asked if she had ever contemplated suicide.4th and 5th grade pupils spent an entire afternoon session memorizing the theme song from MASH,the title of which is Suicide Is Painless.These are some of the things going on in suicide education.Join us again next week and we will be discussing the fastest growing movement,home schooling.Phyllis-Schlafly Live on parents' rights and education presented by the USA Radio Network and by Eagle-Forum,a leading pro-family organization since 1972.Stay informed on what the public schools are teaching our children with Phyllis-Schlafly Live on parents' rights and education.
