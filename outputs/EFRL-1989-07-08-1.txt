**spk_0:** [00:02.78 - 00:13.49] 50 million young adults who attended public schools in the last 20 years cannot read well enough to read the daily newspapers.Is this the biggest civil rights issue today?

**spk_1:** [00:16.19 - 01:00.17] There was another story in the news this week about a basketball star who graduated from high school but couldn't read his own diploma.Do you think these news stories are a bit oddball,or do you think they're typical of a general failure of the government schools to teach our children the fundamental skill of reading?Welcome to Phyllis Schlaffly Live,our.Toll-free number is 1-800-736-3202.Get in while the getting is good,as we like to say,because you have a chance to talk with one of America's most admired and respected women just a couple segments down the line.Phyllis,this has been going on for nearly a quarter century,the problem of illiteracy in the public

**spk_0:** [01:00.17 - 02:40.03] schools,absolutely it was.In 1955,Rudolph Flech wrote his great book called Why Johnny Can't Read.Fortunately,it came out the year my oldest son was,uh,5 years old.I followed Flesch's advice and started on the project of teaching all my children to read so they would not be functional illiterates,and they're doing real well now.Yes,they did very well.Thank you.Secretary of Education Laurel Cavazos recently issued a report in which he said that 27 million young adults are illiterate.That means they cannot read road signs or the help wanted columns in the newspaper.And Cavasso said another 40 to 60 million young adults are only marginally literate.That means they can read only at about a 5th grade level,and they cannot read any important books of history,biography,literature,government,science,or philosophy.This is the most appalling failure of our elementary and secondary schools for which the taxpayers are generously paying nearly $5000 per year per pupil.If they don't learn to read in the 1st grade,all the other 11 years in school are pretty much a waste of time.All those hours and years are spent in discussions or games or passively looking at films or videos instead of reading wonderful books.Today we're going to explore the question of.Why the public schools have turned out so many illiterates and ask whether current trends in reading methods and tests are moving toward a solution or may indeed be part of the problem.

**spk_1:** [02:40.09 - 02:56.63] And our first guest today is Charlotte Izerby,a former official of the US Department of Education in the first Reagan administration.A freelance writer who spent pretty much of her life researching the education policy.We go now to Camden,Maine,to the office of Mrs.Iserbez.

**spk_0:** [02:57.28 - 02:59.71] Hello,Charlotte.Glad to welcome you to this program.

**spk_2:** [03:00.52 - 03:00.70] Thank you very much,

**spk_0:** [03:00.80 - 03:23.12] Phyllis.Charlotte,in the face of.These studies and reports,and there have been lots of them that show the high levels of illiteracy in the United States.Some educators are promoting a new technique called whole language that's spelled W H O L E language.Do you think this is going to improve reading skills or do you think it's going to make them worse?

**spk_3:** [03:23.44 - 03:56.98] Well,I think if,if anything,it's going to make them worse because it's,it's similar to the look,say method of teaching reading.And uh that's,you know,one word,looking at one word.Now it's looking at a phrase.What difference does it make?The children aren't being taught the essential skills,the decoding skills which come only through hearing the words from the teacher,speaking them,looking on the board,and identifying different sounds.There's no way that this is going to improve an already dismal situation.

**spk_0:** [03:57.18 - 04:04.18] For the benefit of our listeners,would you call the look say method of teaching reading a sort of a guessing game?

**spk_2:** [04:04.38 - 04:05.08] Oh,absolutely,

**spk_3:** [04:05.34 - 04:41.13] and I,I'm not a professional educator and or a reading instructor,but I believe that the professionals have called it exactly that.Uh,Professor Jean Chao,who is with the Harvard Laboratory,Reading Laboratory,very well known,uh,professor,has spoken out against the whole language,uh,method of teaching.She recognizes the fact that it is guessing,and she has pointed out,although nobody seems to want to listen to her,that most of the children coming into her laboratory are all,uh,a result of their,their lack of skills are a result of whole language instruction.

**spk_0:** [04:41.60 - 04:53.24] Is the look say method of reading,uh,would you say it is simply a memorization of a lot of words and then relating it to the pictures on the page so that you can recognize them?Yes,

**spk_3:** [04:53.41 - 04:53.88] that's right.

**spk_0:** [04:54.08 - 04:59.73] And then how would you describe whole language?Simply doing a cluster of words and a phrase?

**spk_3:** [05:00.00 - 05:50.78] Exactly.I,in fact,I think it's even more devastating because it puts more of a burden on the child.So that what he's doing is he's memorizing a cluster or a phrase or whatever,but it really doesn't mean anything when the outside factors are taken away from him.I mean,he can,he can see it,but he can't hear anything,so he's going to be pronouncing words incorrectly.As I pointed out in,in my article,and Frank,actually,um,Sam Blumenfeld is the one who's done such excellent work in this,this area,and I think that what he had said,and I use this in my article was,uh,That the children end up saying,you know,horse for pony,and because they see a horse or a pony and it doesn't the sound of the word means nothing to

**spk_2:** [05:50.78 - 05:51.56] them.You mean like,

**spk_0:** [05:51.62 - 05:53.95] like father or daddy?Yes,that's right,

**spk_3:** [05:54.18 - 06:41.91] daddy for father or Solomon for salami.They read,they read words inaccurately.It's like a guessing game.They're taught that letter order is not significant as they search for meaning.And then also they mutilate words.They would read,for instance,delicacy for delinquency or telescope words,you know,read testing the iron for testing the heat of the iron.And Phyllis,uh,I'd like to point out here because a lot of people are going to say,oh well,you know,it's not as serious a problem as you're making it out to be because a few kids may fall through the cracks.Well,you know,a few kids is probably 1/3.I've talked to Sam Blumenfeld about this.The others are not going to be good readers,the other 2/3,but 1/3 is guaranteed.To never be able to

**spk_0:** [06:41.91 - 07:03.83] read.According to Dr.Cavasos's recent report,he admits that 13 are illiterate,as you say,but really another 1/3 is only marginally literate,which means they really can't read anything important.And then even the third that does learn how to read by hook or by crook,they can't spell.

**spk_3:** [07:04.37 - 07:04.88] That's,that's right.

**spk_0:** [07:05.09 - 07:10.96] So nobody can spell because they don't know the,the syllables of the syllables of the words.

**spk_3:** [07:11.20 - 07:32.22] That's correct.But they're again,they're not going to have to be able to spell because they have these spelling machines now,you know,they have these little,not not only do they have handheld calculators for math,but they have the spelling.Uh,whatever you call them machines that can use that.There's no need whatsoever,according to the educators moving into the year 2000,for children to have these basic skills.

**spk_0:** [07:32.56 - 07:38.36] Now,now listen,there is a need.There are a lot of words that the spell check can't catch.

**spk_2:** [07:38.43 - 07:38.76] That's right,

**spk_0:** [07:38.88 - 07:44.80] like for example,example,the difference between the two kinds of principles.Exactly.And

**spk_2:** [07:45.41 - 07:46.26] that's right,

**spk_0:** [07:46.64 - 07:51.24] and you have to know something about spelling to even look it up in the dictionary you know what you're talking about.

**spk_3:** [07:51.88 - 09:28.37] Well,I,I feel they're looking at a different world than the one that most of the parents out there are looking at and that we're looking at.They're looking at a world where there won't be,uh,the great need for higher education,intellectual,academic education,and they've come out.They've been pretty clear about what they're looking at.In fact,they're,they've,uh,come right out.Two well-known reading researchers,uh,Harman and Stickt,uh,said just a couple of years ago that,uh.Ending discrimination and changing values are probably more important than reading in moving low-income families into the uh middle class.And then he talks about the need,what,what,what the need is that uh The dependability of a labor force is very crucial and how well it can be managed and trained,not its general educational level.And I think that when people like that speak like that,you know,listeners out there,they better pay attention.I suspect an awful lot of parents and even some teachers,they hear a quote like that and they say,oh,you know,that's just one person.But I have too many of these quotes and,and the intent is not to give our children the solid,sound basic education that uh they were given when I was growing up.And we look back to 1981 with the nation at Risk report and they came out and said we were in such bad shape and there shouldn't be any finger pointing at the educators who might have been involved and I say we're deeply involved.Uh,no finger

**spk_2:** [09:28.37 - 09:29.01] pointing.Well,

**spk_0:** [09:29.05 - 09:54.26] indeed we should have some finger pointing,and you need to be able to read even if you don't go to college because of one of the problems we're having now is the,the people in manual labor jobs who cannot read the safety instructions or the instructions about how to use machinery.Very dangerous.Well,Charlotte,would you tell.How the new reading tests are disguising the failure to teach reading by the schools.Well,

**spk_3:** [09:54.38 - 11:29.02] I think that this,uh,you've probably read the same definition that I read of the Michigan Reading Association,which,by the way,is an affiliate of the International Reading Association that has been pushing the,the whole language,the look,say.Ever since 1930,and that's why our children can't read because of that.But anyway,the Michigan Reading Association that is affiliated with the International Reading Association,um,the new definition of reading is very,very interesting.It reads,I'm going to read it as follows.Uh,it says that Um,first of all,the position paper asserts that research during the past 15 years has led to significant advances,that's what they say,in theory and practice,specifically indicating that reading,now I get this,is the process of constructing meaning through the dynamic interaction among the reader.The text and the context of the reading situation.Now this is very,very different,uh,from what we've had in the past,and they even admit it.This is in contrast to the view implied by Michigan's previous objectives and tests that reading is a series of sequential and hierarchical skills.Now we go on and this is why,as you said,Phyllis,uh,how are you ever going to know whether the children can read or not because the test is a very,very strange test.It has 3 areas and the new objectives are in the areas of constructing meaning,knowledge about reading,and attitudes and self-perceptions.

**spk_0:** [11:29.90 - 11:36.78] Well,we're not interested in the attitude of the child.We want to know whether he can read the print that's in front of him on the page.

**spk_2:** [11:36.91 - 11:37.84] Absolutely correct.

**spk_3:** [11:37.96 - 12:45.25] So what they're going to be doing is they're going to be teaching towards these three areas.Rather than giving them the skills to be able to decode words and enlarge the vocabulary and to,to read well.Uh,there,and then the test itself.will use,they're not going to test the child on the reading unless the child has been exposed to information about what he's reading,which is basically terribly unfair because you're not going to get,I don't know how you feel about this,Phyllis.This is the way I've been able to interpret it.You're not going to be able to get a picture of whether the child would be able to pick up the local newspaper in the morning at 8 o'clock without ever having seen.Uh,the paper before or anything about the,the particular article and read it.Uh,these are crutches that it looks to me like they're going to be giving the child these crutches.They're gonna teach him about,say,Uh,automobiles in the early 20th century they can have a discussion about it and so that the child becomes immersed in that and then only after he's been immersed in that particular subject will he be allowed to be tested.

**spk_0:** [12:45.45 - 13:04.71] So in other words,he guesses at it or makes up the story as he goes along.Don't you think the parents should test their children by giving them something.Doesn't come from the school.Something out of the newspaper or a book that you have at home,uh,something that doesn't have pictures on the page,so you can really test whether the child can read or not.Oh,

**spk_3:** [13:04.79 - 13:53.57] they absolutely have got to do this,but I think also the most important thing for parents,and I've just gotten down to sort of a 11 sentence proposal for the parents out there,and it is that they have got to understand that what they want for their children.Which is basically a good academic education in a school that supports the parents' values.That is not what the educators want for their children,although both the parents and the educators use the same words.And as long as it is vital for parents to understand this,Phyllis,because as long as they don't understand that the educators want something different for their children than what they want,their children are going to be at risk and will be prey.

**spk_0:** [13:54.01 - 14:00.45] Well,Charlotte,in the 30 seconds that are left,tell us why you think reading is a civil rights issue.Well,

**spk_3:** [14:00.65 - 14:42.48] obviously if you can't read,you can't support yourself income wise or you can't defend yourself and say you have a traffic violation,you can't go to court.If you can't read,you can't go to court and express yourself.Uh,it's,it's,it depends on reading is the core of our freedoms.And I'm,I don't believe there could be anybody out there who won't agree with that.And uh writing basically is very essential in order to be able to express yourself.So,uh,it is a civil rights issue and it's,it's one I believe that we could attack more successfully or more quickly.

**spk_0:** [14:43.62 - 14:48.68] Well,thank you very much,Charlotte.We're out of time.We appreciate you coming on the line with us today.

**spk_1:** [14:48.94 - 15:15.95] Charlotte Phyllis obviously reforms our nudity in the methods in which we teach our children to.And that's what we're going to zero in on our next segment,and we'll be talking with our next guest momentarily.Now,if you'd like a cassette copy of today's program,will you write us and send $5?Here's our address,Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002 on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [18:44.76 - 20:32.47] what I would do is,uh,what I did.And that is to teach my own children to read before they entered school.The great book by Rudolph Flech in 1955 laid it all out,and he told how this looks say method is really an attempt to teach reading by the Chinese method of just having some squiggles on the page without relating it to the syllables or the sounds of the words.Now the English language is at least 90% phonetic and.If you teach the child the syllables and the sounds of the English language,then he can put them together like building blocks.The difference between the two methods is absolutely dramatic.A child who's been taught by the looks say,or what is now called whole language may know 350 words by the end of the first grade,1000 words by the end of the second grade,1500 words by the end of the third grade.But the child who's been taught by the phonics method can know his whole oral vocabulary in the first grade,which is approximately 25,000 words.Take for example a word of four syllables like helicopter.Now in the whole language or the look say method,the child might not get to a long word like that until the 4th or 5th grade.Uh,he might never learn it unless he's shown a picture of a helicopter.But in the first grade if the child is er is uh taught to sound out helicopter,he's always,uh,they've all seen a helicopter on television and once he sounds it out,then he can read it.So I would urge you to teach your own children by the phonics method and,uh,that would be very successful at something.with me.

**spk_1:** [20:32.68 - 20:40.67] Sounds a lot more efficient.I'll tell you that.Let's see what our listeners have.It's Bob in Trenton,New Jersey over WCHR.Hi Bob.Hello,

**spk_0:** [20:41.60 - 20:45.84] hello Bob.Glad to hear from you.Have you got something to say about phonics or illiteracy?

**spk_6:** [20:46.12 - 21:57.55] Sure,I'm a public school teacher.I've taught various grade levels,uh,kindergarten through 8th grade for the last 14 years.And,uh,currently I teach,uh,computer education in a public school system in Trenton,New Jersey,and what you're saying is right on target.We're just not teaching our kids to read,uh,and basically that means we're not teaching them to survive.The problem is so rampant through our society,uh,and my next remark is not meant to be unkind towards my colleagues,uh,throughout the nation,uh.I have received memos from superiors.I've seen,um,literature put out by the school district,uh,posters that are hung around town on behalf of the school district,and so forth with gross spelling errors,uh,syntax errors,grammatical mistakes,sentences that don't have punctuation or capitalization properly in them,and apparently nothing is seen wrong with this.Uh,this summer I'm,uh,teaching the high school proficiency test,uh,makeup sessions to students who failed part of the HSPT.

**spk_0:** [21:58.25 - 21:59.47] Uh,what's an HSPT?

**spk_6:** [21:59.71 - 22:01.29] The high school proficiency test,

**spk_0:** [22:01.87 - 22:02.03] uh,

**spk_6:** [22:02.12 - 22:22.92] which you must pass in order to graduate from high school here in New Jersey,and,uh,these students are students who took the test once and have flunked at least part of it,and they have to retake that part.The shame of it is that many of the students just don't know that they have been gypped educationally.

**spk_0:** [22:23.54 - 22:25.95] It is a cheat.It's a consumer fraud,isn't it?

**spk_6:** [22:26.35 - 23:21.54] In many ways it is.The sad thing that's happening,of course,is that considering that this has been happening to our country for the last 40 years or so.Um,we now have teachers and school administrators who have been given 2nd rate educations.Therefore,they can only teach a 2nd or 3rd rate level of education.They don't know that they were gypped.My own colleagues don't recognize the inadequacies that they have,and some that do,uh,perhaps feel that it's more important to cover it up or pretend that you don't have this deficiency than it is to correct it.My wife and I taught our own son.Uh,we have 3 children.Our oldest is a boy age 9.Uh,just got out of 3rd grade and he's at least 3 years ahead of his peers on the standardized reading test.We taught him informally phonics reading

**spk_0:** [23:21.73 - 23:30.69] and it's very easy to do.I,I compare it like teaching your child to ride a bike or other things that the parents do.It's very exciting.

**spk_6:** [23:30.82 - 23:48.17] It came quite naturally because we would simply,as we encountered words,whether we were driving in the car or reading the newspaper or a book with him.Uh,teach him the decoding skills that we ourselves had learned when we were youngsters.I'm 38 and probably on the edge of the last phonics taught generation.

**spk_0:** [23:48.98 - 24:07.24] A couple of years ago,I spoke to a state convention of the Michigan Reading Association.About phonics and I looked out at this nicely dressed audience and they didn't really know what I was talking about because none of them had had phonics.Uh,they didn't understand the defects of the present reading methods.

**spk_6:** [24:07.36 - 24:18.42] Yeah,you,you said something earlier in the program.If,if they don't learn to read by 1st or 2nd grade,uh,the rest of the years are misery in the public schools for them.

**spk_0:** [24:19.12 - 24:30.03] They say that the highest correlation of the people in prison with any other factor is illiteracy.If you can't read,what kind of a job are you going to hold?

**spk_6:** [24:30.14 - 25:04.82] Absolutely no survival skills.It's interesting that the National Education Association,which just had its convention this past.Fourth of July holiday down in Washington.One of the proposals that they came out with was that the,the governments,whether it's federal,state,or local,should,uh,endeavor to put a computer on the desk of every teacher in the nation.Unfortunately we've got teachers that wouldn't know how to operate it.And again,of course,the,the uh Upshot of the NEA's request is spend more money.

**spk_0:** [25:04.98 - 25:06.86] That's right.All they want to do is spend more money.

**spk_6:** [25:06.94 - 25:28.42] Well,you know,if the NEA really had teachers and children's interests in mind and heart,they would take millions of dollars that they pour into political action for other causes and put those computers on our desks anyway,and they would put dictionaries and books and thesaurus into the hands of,uh,students.And yes,I,I know that the plural of thesaurus is thesauri.

**spk_0:** [25:29.87 - 25:33.51] All right,Bob,thank you very much for calling in.We'll go to another call.

**spk_1:** [25:33.67 - 25:35.63] Phyllis,here is Sally in Michigan.

**spk_0:** [25:35.79 - 28:44.23] Hello,Sally.Hi Phyllis.Do you have a comment on this subject?Well,Michigan is,um,they have been piloting a new Michigan educational assessment program,uh,test.It's called the MEAP,and it's a reading,the reading test that's given every year in October to the 4th graders,the 7th graders,and the 11th graders.Uh,our children were involved in the pilot program about a year ago,and I questioned the test because it is not testing reading skills or cognitive skills.It is testing opinions,feelings,and values,and our teachers in the district had the same concerns.Well,were they calling it a reading test?Yes,it is called,uh,the reading test.There's two divisions.It's called topic familiarity,and that's where they ask.The students about if they're familiar with the the topic that is going to be in the story and um then they give a little story and ask questions and it may be how you feel about this or did you like reading this?Well,we're really not interested in testing how the child feels about the story.Uh,don't we want to know whether he read it or not,whether he can read it or not,right.You might be interested to know that our next issue of the Education Reporter,which is published by Eagle-Forum,uh,will have a large piece on this Michigan assessment test.Now I guess the use of the word assessment is they're trying to assess the uh the skills that the children have or your relationship to other states or whether you're accomplishing the goal of really teaching children what they ought to be taught uh but if the test is defective and the test doesn't test those things uh how is anybody going to know whether they're learning how to read or not?Correct,and even the teachers admitted that the task confused the children.Didn't the teachers,didn't some of the teachers also complain that there were a lot of questions on the test,for which there were no right or wrong answers?Now,can you explain to me how a test could,could,uh,correctly assess some type of academic achievement if there is no right or wrong answer?Well,that was my question to the school.What did they say?Um,they,you know,they just went along with the test and like I say,the teachers did,they were very nice and they voiced the same concerns,but they had,they said they had to give the pilot test.Uh,are the orders coming down from on high somewhere?Yes,the Michigan Department of Education.And do you think they have federal funding in this project?Uh,I believe so.After researching this,yes,well,to give you an,uh,an example of what's wrong with this test,um,it would be fine to ask a child whether he can read the word sad,but it would be wrong to ask him what makes you sad and then call that a reading test.Is that your impression of what this Michigan test is doing?Well,one of the questions is not being able to solve a problem can

**spk_1:** [28:44.23 - 28:44.43] make

**spk_0:** [28:44.43 - 28:44.59] you

**spk_1:** [28:44.59 - 28:44.99] sad,

**spk_0:** [30:45.33 - 30:55.49] July issue will have a great deal about the new Michigan reading tests that are not reading tests at all and we'll explain why they are defective and a

**spk_1:** [30:55.49 - 31:13.17] lot of other informative stories that might just help you out.We're at 1-800-736-3202.1-800-736-3202.Switchboards are lit up,but still some room for you to get in.And let's go to Judy in Illinois over KSIV.

**spk_0:** [31:13.37 - 33:14.93] Hello Judy,what is your question or comment?Yes,Phyllis,some time ago I was working as a special personality on one of the local radio stations here.And I found that I was having a hard time being able to read some of the words.Uh,I,I,I'm in my 50s and started realizing back in the 40s that I had not received the phonics like I should have had.And we got to studying back with my mother and finding out that for 5 years in that period of time,they decided they were going to use the sight method.So there's a whole gang of us out here.That's right.You were probably among the first,uh,from whom phonics was taken away completely.And uh do you know I,I do a lot of debating on college campuses and I have had very attractive intelligent looking young men and women,college students come up to me and say that after they got to college they found.Didn't read well enough to stay in college and they had to do some phonics work in order to be able to read the the the books that were assigned to them.Well,what,uh,what I did,I was,uh,as I said,I was working with the radio station and I was doing personal appearances and happened to go down to,of course they expect you to pronounce things correctly on radio stations.That's right.And working with the blind radio station also at the shrine,but I went down to the Redbud High School.And they had a poster there talking about the fact of adults helping adults.And I got finally started going through BAC.I went to,uh,Lewis and Clark.Nobody knew anything about doing basic reading.They are not teaching it,just basic reading.So I finally got to the basic education class out at BAC College,Belle Area College,and they have a program that they are working with,uh,people who are having problems,illiterate,

**spk_2:** [33:15.01 - 33:24.48] but they told me I was one of the few that they'd ever had to deal with it and that they tried to help.Who had could read Psychology today or whatever.

**spk_0:** [33:24.97 - 34:04.42] Well,it's,it's more difficult I think to teach an adult by the good methods.It's just like if you're going to take up tennis or golf,you ask any professional instructor,they would rather give lessons to someone who has never swung a golf club or swung a tennis racket than someone who'd been swinging it wrong for a lot of years and then they have to.Uh,uh,unlearn the bad methods and then teach the right methods.Well,that's true in almost anything.A lot of your,um,different,your big companies want to go in and get the kids right off the college campuses rather than retraining.Well,thank you very much,Judy,for calling.

**spk_1:** [34:05.26 - 34:09.47] And let's go out to Spokane over KUDY.Here's Bonnie,

**spk_0:** [34:09.54 - 34:12.09] Phyllis.Hello,Bonnie.What is your question or comment?

**spk_2:** [34:12.22 - 34:32.14] Um,I just wanted to comment.About 2 years ago,I was hired for Spokane School District teaching,you know,and tutoring hand in hand with the teachers in the special education departments.And there was one classroom where I found about half of the kids were not able to read at all and they were all very embarrassed about it.

**spk_0:** [34:32.31 - 34:33.27] And what grade was this?

**spk_2:** [34:33.40 - 34:34.23] This was 7th grade.

**spk_0:** [34:34.35 - 34:36.33] 7th grade,half the kids couldn't read,

**spk_2:** [34:36.63 - 34:37.03] basically,

**spk_0:** [34:37.11 - 34:43.15] yeah,isn't that sad?What have they been doing in the 2nd,3rd,4th,5th,and 6th grades?

**spk_2:** [34:43.31 - 34:44.40] I have no idea.

**spk_0:** [34:44.71 - 34:45.99] So what did you do?Well,

**spk_2:** [34:46.07 - 35:27.95] I asked the teacher.He was teaching them,um.Applicable type lessons.He figured they weren't smart enough to learn how to,to learn anything more.He just wanted to teach them general survival type things.So I asked him if he,if I could take a handful of these um really bad readers to the media center,which is their library,and to teach them how to read with the material we had.And he said no.He,he was afraid that I would take away his loyalty from his students or something.And so I was unable to teach these children how to read and it was a general consensus of that particular department of the school.They were afraid that they were kind of scared of me.

**spk_3:** [35:28.00 - 35:29.58] I think.How sad

**spk_0:** [35:29.58 - 36:22.60] like me.How sad.I went to a dinner in the east and I sat next to a woman who,uh,teaches social studies in 7th grade in the Philadelphia schools,and I said to her,Can they read?And she said,no.And I said,what do you,what do you do in class?Oh,we discuss and we draw on the blackboard and,and we look at,yeah,look at movies,teach sex education.Yes,you don't,you don't need to be able to read very many words.To,uh,to be taught sex education,well,that's,uh,that's very sad.It's very sad,and it seems that there is a whole establishment that is going against the teaching of reading.When Rudolph Flach wrote his great book,he said millions of Americans cannot read simply because.They have never been taught how and it's still true.Let's work

**spk_1:** [36:22.60 - 36:30.28] in some more telephone calls before break.Let's go out to Fort Walton Beach,Florida,WPSN,and here's Mary.

**spk_0:** [36:30.68 - 36:31.58] Hello Mary.

**spk_2:** [36:31.80 - 36:34.20] Yes,I have a question about achievement tests.

**spk_0:** [36:34.60 - 36:35.49] Yes.Now I've

**spk_2:** [36:35.49 - 36:52.39] heard somewhere that there's achievement tests that Uh,teach or ask about values clarification rather than testing the skills.I'm aware of this,uh,California Test of Basic Skills and the CAT,but what are the other achievement tests and what ones should we watch out for?

**spk_0:** [36:52.79 - 37:56.36] The one that is going to be inaugurated in Michigan this fall,which will be described in our July education reporter is supposed to be a reading test,but it has a lot of questions that ask about attitudes,values,behavior,that sort of question.Uh,here's a question.Uh,being teased causes you to feel sad sometimes,yes or no?Or when,when you are sad,you often feel unpleasant,yes or no.Or not being able to solve a problem can make you sad,yes or no.Now those are values questions that invade the privacy of the child which may or may not have some utility,but in any event you cannot describe them as reading,uh,skills questions.And uh there are all kinds of of questionnaires in the schools that do test attitudes,behaviors,uh,values,and so forth and I think you should warn your children to be on guard against them.There's no reason why they have to answer those questions.

**spk_2:** [37:56.90 - 38:02.72] Well,since I'm not in Michigan,I'm in Florida.I'm wondering about the,the standard tests that are used nationwide.

**spk_0:** [38:03.40 - 38:40.72] Uh,there are starting to be some new tests put out by what's called NAEPP,uh,that is the National Assessment Testing,uh,that branch of our government and the Department of Education has recently got a,got a great deal of new money,and they want to institute testing nationwide.You should be on the lookout for questions for which there are no right or wrong answers.That's the clue to it.You think about a question and then then say,is there a definite clear cut right answer?And if there isn't,you can be suspicious that it's values clarification.About a

**spk_1:** [38:40.72 - 38:43.71] minute left.Let's go out to Marcy in Ambler,Pennsylvania.

**spk_0:** [38:43.84 - 38:44.67] Hello,Marcy.

**spk_2:** [38:44.80 - 39:02.29] Yes,hi,Phyllis.Why,uh,it just so happens I have a comment that goes along with that woman that just,uh,Mary from Florida.Right here in Pennsylvania,a group of very,very alert parents have stopped what they called the TEELS test.

**spk_0:** [39:02.52 - 39:03.32] What does that stand for?

**spk_2:** [39:03.62 - 39:54.60] That stood stood,it stood for at one time testing of essential literacy and learning skills.Now,in the last few years since 1984 when it was passed as a test through our legislator,was adopted through the legislature.If they dropped the word literacy,so it became tells for essential learning skills and this is exactly what this woman was questioning that it was um very easy once you sold the test itself,which we were not allowed to see for years we finally did.It was testing.The children's opinions in all social issues,opinions,from the opinions,they get what their backgrounds are,their beliefs,their values,their attitudes on everything had nothing to do with literacy,nothing to do with reading.The other comment that I was going to call in for,I just happened to be able to answer that right now.

**spk_0:** [39:54.86 - 40:04.08] Marcy,uh,we're out of time.We need to take a couple of announcements,but would you hang on and we'll come back.We want to hear more about this after the announcement.All right,thank you.

**spk_0:** [42:48.03 - 42:59.08] Back to Marcy in Pennsylvania.I want to ask you if you can give our listeners an example or two of the type of questions that they can be on the lookout for in these tests.

**spk_2:** [42:59.24 - 43:52.62] In this particular test,uh,it was sort of renamed Pennsylvania assessment System and it incorporated the Educational Quality assessment,which was the psychological test that the state of Pennsylvania withdrew from use,but they reincorporated.They put EQA and Tels together.The type of questions that they ask this particular page of questions are um.Social issues,paragraphs of social issues all around the world and all kinds of social issues.I don't have one in front of me right now,but the child reads the paragraph and then they're asked to either make comments or what do you feel from or how do you believe this is or whatever.It has nothing to do with how they read.It is the answer of what they believe is in that the information is in that paragraph.

**spk_0:** [43:52.92 - 44:06.05] And then the answer the child gives could have no relation to what he read.That's right.In other words,the child could say what he thinks or believes from his from his background,and you would never know whether he actually read the paragraph or not.

**spk_2:** [44:06.36 - 44:06.58] Exactly.

**spk_0:** [44:06.76 - 44:08.35] And they call this a reading test.

**spk_2:** [44:08.52 - 44:29.52] Yes,and that is supposed to be the reading test that puts all kids into reading remediation.And every child must take it,or the school district is in jeopardy of being fined or threatened with all kinds of things.And of course it scares the school district people to death.If one parent says,look,I don't want my child taking that,it isn't necessary.She's getting all A's.

**spk_0:** [44:29.71 - 44:30.99] Did your child take

**spk_2:** [44:30.99 - 45:01.00] this test?No,but a friend of mine with twin daughters did,was able to not take the test 3 years ago.This year they absolutely forced her,and she went through about 6 weeks of arguments up to the state level.Threat being threatened with a solicitor being sent after her either from the school district or from the state level,and her two daughters,twin daughters have done beautifully.They're honor students.They read beautifully.They do,they do not need remediation.They do not need to take this kind of test.

**spk_0:** [45:01.04 - 45:03.06] And the test didn't test achievement anyway.

**spk_2:** [45:03.40 - 45:40.49] No,wasn't doing that anyway.So they're after other information other than whether children can read or write.Now my comment was originally going to be this.That there are billions and billions of dollars poured into education every year and millions and millions more poured in at,uh,at the state level and local level.Teachers knew how to teach children how to read up to the time I went to school and my children started in school.And then they started changing it.They don't need Npe.They don't need these assessments.They don't need tells.Teachers know how to teach kids to read,and it's a phonics method.

**spk_0:** [45:40.65 - 45:50.59] If we would just let them do it,just let them do it.But as you heard from a previous caller,they wouldn't let her do it.Well,thank you very much,Marcy,for calling.We appreciate your insight and over.

**spk_1:** [45:51.11 - 45:52.70] PSIV in St.Louis.Here's Mary.

**spk_0:** [45:52.79 - 45:53.64] Hello Mary.

**spk_7:** [45:53.99 - 46:49.81] Yes,Phyllis,I'm coming from a little different perspective.I'm a mother of 3 children and my oldest is going to be 7,but last October when he had just turned 6,I started teaching him phonics.And he,it took us about 6 months of,of intensive phonics program,and at that time I didn't use any other materials,just doing the phonics,and after 6 months,he was reading,um.Simple books and now after 9 months he's reading at a 2nd grade level.Now we,what we did was we did 20 minute sessions and we did 3 to 5 a day and um it's worked really well and I'm very proud of what he's done and of what I've accomplished.In the beginning I was very.Um,I didn't know if I was going to be able to do it.

**spk_0:** [46:49.95 - 46:52.21] Do you have,do you have a teacher's certificate?

**spk_7:** [46:52.67 - 46:54.51] No,I don't.I'm an RN,

**spk_0:** [46:55.19 - 46:57.78] but you,uh,you just did this and it worked

**spk_7:** [46:58.19 - 47:29.52] right.Now I'm in a group of homeschoolers,and that's very important to be a part of a group because the mothers and sometimes fathers,um,give you different ideas.Each child is different and each.way of teaching is each child needs a different method of teaching.I thought my second one,I would,you know,follow the same way with the first,but I don't know if that will work.My second right now has just turned 5,but I'm going to wait another year until he's 6 before I start teaching him.

**spk_0:** [47:29.92 - 47:53.73] Well,thank you very much for giving this encouragement to other mothers.I think any mother can do it if you make up your mind to do it.And uh I tell them that teaching a child to read is as exciting as watching a baby walk for the first time.I,there's nothing else that's so exciting when you see a child walk across the floor and fall in your arms for the first time.That's really exciting.

**spk_7:** [47:53.99 - 48:35.37] Well,it has brought us closer together,but there are,it's not all easy.There are some hard days,and we work through those,and in all that it has brought us closer together.One thing that kind of bothers me in the homeschooling circles,some of the mothers don't know there's a,there's a way of doing it and don't know exactly how to approach.Reading,uh,or teaching the,the phonics method and,um,I have found that,that the 20 minute sessions for a six year old,that's all that they can.Take he would say,when is 20 minutes up or that was as long as he could stand.Well,

**spk_0:** [48:35.47 - 48:41.82] little boys are not designed to sit quietly on a chair for any longer than 20 minutes at that age.That's what I think.

**spk_7:** [48:42.02 - 49:24.99] And there's one more thing,um,I'm in in the public school system that where we live.The,the little boy next door goes to the school and I've talked to his mother about doing homeschooling.Of course,everybody thinks that this is unusual,and she told me that her son was learning phonics in the public school system.So I,I didn't know,but I started questioning her about exactly what,what phonics he was learning in school,and she couldn't tell me.So,uh maybe they are learning it,um,in this particular school,uh,district,but I,I don't know.She didn't know.Well,

**spk_0:** [49:25.00 - 49:47.51] surveys show that 90% of the public schools do not use phonics,although many of them tell you they're using phonics.Phonics does not mean just telling them to talk about what letter the word starts with.So I'm sorry.Mary,we're out of time now.Thank you for your call.I hope you've given encouragement to other,other mothers to do likewise.Phyllis,

**spk_1:** [49:47.55 - 50:04.79] we have a whole packet of information on the illiteracy problem in the public schools.It can be yours if you write us.Uh,please include $10.Address Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.We will return on the USA Radio Network with Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_8:** [50:08.52 - 51:04.79] The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,a place where the most powerful man in the world resides,the president of the United States.But what many Americans don't know is that some of our nation's most important decisions aren't made in the Oval Office.Because according to the constitution,the power to make laws was granted only to Congress and not to the president.That's why only Congress can declare war,raise and support armies,and approve treaties.The bill is passed.The Constitution,the words we live by.To receive a free copy of this great document and information about it,write Constitution,Washington DC 200063999.A message from the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution and the Advertising Council.

**spk_0:** [52:06.07 - 52:45.95] About once a year we see a publicity campaign about banned books usually sponsored by the American Library Association.Often these displays will show pictures of William Shakespeare and other great authors.The tragic part of these displays is that the majority of young adults who've been in public schools in the last 20 years don't have the reading skills necessary to read any great books,and the reason is that the phonics reading method has been censored out of first grade readers and replaced with a guessing game.Next week we'll have an exciting program on the controversial drug education program called Quest.
