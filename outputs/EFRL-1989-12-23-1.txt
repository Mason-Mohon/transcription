**spk_0:** [00:01.48 - 00:09.89] The most significant reform in education today is giving parents the right to choose the public school their children attend.Let's talk about it.

**spk_1:** [00:12.25 - 00:54.02] Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.This is Bruce Hayes inviting you to stay with us for the next hour.This is the program that puts you at the forefront of what's really happening in public education.We won't be taking your calls today because we know you're probably busy wrapping up those Christmas gifts,but we have some very important guests to talk with today.They'll discuss the issue of allowing parents to have choice in selecting a public school for.Children choice means the policy of allowing students to enroll in any public school instead of the present system of mandatory assignment of each child on the basis of his residence or an arbitrary rule of the school administrators.

**spk_0:** [00:54.26 - 01:49.90] Our first guest today is Undersecretary of Education Ted Sanders.He's had a very distinguished career in education all his life and all over the country.He started.Out as a teacher both for elementary and secondary school levels and prior to his present post,he was superintendent of education both in Nevada and in Illinois.He joined the US Department of Education by appointment of President Bush and Secretary Laurel Cavazos.Hello,Ted Sanders.Good morning Phy.So glad to have you with us.I'm delighted to be here.The first time I heard about this idea of choice in public schools.and getting into the national consciousness was when the National Governors Association endorsed the idea at the national meeting in Hilton Head,South Carolina in 1986.And now it's one of the major initiatives of the Bush administration.So let's start by you're telling our listeners what you're doing about it and what it means.

**spk_2:** [01:50.04 - 02:20.56] OK,what we're,we're doing more than just promoting a program while there are Uh,legislative initiatives that we're promoting,uh,that deal with choice.Beyond that,uh,what the president's doing is promoting a strategy that would prompt,uh,state and local decision makers to afford,uh,choice programs,uh,that would allow.To choose the school where their children attend to,to,uh,uh,parents across the country.So we're really talking about a strategy and not a program that we're carrying out.

**spk_0:** [02:20.84 - 02:25.85] I suppose it would have to be passed either by the state legislature or by the local school board.Yes,

**spk_2:** [02:25.95 - 02:43.88] uh-huh.In fact,we have both models taking place right now.Minnesota's got a statewide program quickly followed by a couple of other states,uh,and places like,uh.New York City and,uh,Richmond,California are good examples where local boards have decided that they would afford parents that opportunity.

**spk_0:** [02:44.14 - 02:49.11] Do you know of any other states where they are about to pass a statewide choice plan?

**spk_2:** [02:49.39 - 03:24.43] Iowa has just done so,as has,uh,Arkansas.They're,uh,Ohio has,uh,passed legislation,and it'll be,uh,several months yet before the options are in place.And the issues being debated extensively in a number of other states,uh,New Mexico,Colorado,in fact,just about every place where we've been,uh,uh,with our five regional strategy meetings,uh,this fall,we found,uh,state policymakers there,uh,uh,either with bills that they were going to be introducing or,uh,with bills that they've,they've already introduced.

**spk_0:** [03:25.66 - 03:29.10] Now like Heinz Pickles can come in lots of different varieties,can't it?

**spk_2:** [03:29.45 - 03:30.07] Yes,it can.

**spk_0:** [03:30.60 - 03:39.60] Um,it can be,uh,complete choice to pick any school,or it can have certain restrictions.Is that right?Can you explain that?

**spk_2:** [03:39.76 - 04:08.64] Absolutely.I guess probably just a couple of examples of places where choice is going is going on.The,the magnet school programs that are supported by the federal government are really programs of choice.They're limited in the sense that choice is only made available though to.A,a limited number of,uh,parents and in those cases under the federal program,uh,they must be to promote,uh,further desegregation in a particular district.

**spk_0:** [04:09.37 - 04:13.81] But they are concentrations on particular areas like math,aren't they?That's correct

**spk_2:** [04:13.81 - 04:37.55] with specialty high schools,uh,yes,that's what they're doing in places like,uh,Richmond,California,or in,uh,Minneapolis,uh,Minnesota.You basically have open enrollment,uh,programs where parents,uh,may,uh,Uh,may choose between and among a wide diversity of schools.They can,they,they all have the,uh,the option of making a choice for their children.

**spk_0:** [04:37.74 - 04:43.39] Now that means in Minnesota any parent can decide any public school that he wants his child to go to.

**spk_2:** [04:43.98 - 04:47.80] Under the state law,yes,they can even cross district lines.

**spk_0:** [04:48.93 - 04:51.93] And I guess the key to that is what happens to the funding.

**spk_2:** [04:52.51 - 05:14.85] Well,the funding in,uh,in that case actually follows the child right to,uh,uh,the,the district,uh,where the parent chooses to enroll the child.That's a very important ingredient to making choice plans work,uh,is to assure that both the,uh,that the funding does indeed follow the child to,uh,to the school.The child is being served.

**spk_0:** [05:15.13 - 05:25.79] Do you have any,any,um,real feeling about how that plan has been working?Do people think it is successful?Is it putting pressure on poorer schools to improve?

**spk_2:** [05:26.37 - 06:21.74] Absolutely.While we were in Minnesota for.The regional meeting,I took the opportunity to actually,uh,visit firsthand to a number of schools,talk to a number of parents,and,uh,yes,there's all kinds of evidence that indeed the,the program there is working.More parents are,uh,actually participating in the program.We heard from lots of parents and lots of students about,uh,what choice it actually meant,uh,to them,even listening to a few,uh,young people who Ah,literally had dropped out of school and who were now back very much,uh,excited about what was going on and succeeding.Uh,choice was working,uh,for them.We also talked to,uh,teachers who had been very,very reluctant in the beginning.In fact,uh,when Minnesota first,uh,uh,put its plan in place,only about 1 out of 3 of their teachers were supported.Today,2 out of 3 are.Well,

**spk_0:** [06:22.51 - 06:27.31] the National Education Association was very bitterly opposed to it,wasn't it?Well,

**spk_2:** [06:27.39 - 06:44.13] they revoted their policy last July here in Washington whenever they were in their annual meeting in opposition to choice.However,as we've been out across the country,we do find teachers and even some teacher leadership that is very,very supportive,but But the

**spk_0:** [06:44.13 - 06:47.01] official NEA position is against it,right?That is

**spk_2:** [06:47.01 - 06:47.02] correct.

**spk_0:** [06:47.56 - 06:51.73] What about the other union,the American Federation of Teachers?Do you know how it stands?Yes,

**spk_2:** [06:51.95 - 07:02.72] AFT,or at least its leadership,Al Shanker has,uh,has noted publicly on a number of occasions where we've been that he is very supportive of parental choice.

**spk_0:** [07:03.41 - 07:07.03] He seems to be more open to a few innovations than the NEA.

**spk_2:** [07:08.07 - 07:09.31] That would appear to be so.

**spk_0:** [07:09.79 - 07:25.98] Well,in,uh,in Minnesota they have one little quirk about the choice that I wonder if you know how it's working,and that is in the,uh,in the last two grades of high school,the student does have the option to simply switch over to a community college,isn't that so?

**spk_2:** [07:26.19 - 07:54.33] That's correct.They can,they call it their postsecondary option and uh.Uh,students can indeed go on to,uh,college,uh,part or all of their days in their last two years of high school,and all of the evidence that we've got at this point is that,that,uh,that's really working quite well,and in fact we found a great deal of interest,uh,in other states in that particular option.I suspect we're going to see it,uh,replicated all across the country very,very quickly.

**spk_0:** [07:54.84 - 08:03.69] In the,uh,the one we've heard about in East Harlem,New York,I suppose that's largely a black school,but that was one of the pioneers of choice,wasn't it?

**spk_2:** [08:03.99 - 08:04.93] That's correct.Tell us how

**spk_0:** [08:04.93 - 08:05.64] that has worked.

**spk_2:** [08:05.75 - 09:56.53] OK.East Harlem or or maybe known to others as Spanish Harlem,is,uh,yes,almost totally minority,both black and Hispanic,and,uh,that program has been in place for the better part of a decade now,and,uh,it allows parents and,uh.In East Harlem School District number 4 to choose between and among about 50 public schools in the district,uh,parents literally may choose,uh,uh,what school,uh,it is that they,uh,desire for,for their child.The schools tend to be very,very small,uh,usually only serving about 150,uh,students.Teachers are very energized.Uh,uh,students are very much on task.In fact,you're really struck when you go into Spanish Harlem.In just,uh,the respect that you see between,uh,uh,teachers and students and students and students,uh,respect for,uh,the school facility,especially when you're looking at,uh,some of those schools looking like they're in a,a war-torn,uh,Europe,uh.The,uh,academic record of the students in East Harlem is very,very impressive.Uh,when,uh,the,the school literally was,uh,an educational disaster,the schools in East Harlem were an educational disaster area,uh,10 years ago.They ranked 32 out of the 32 districts in New York City in academic achievement.That has now jumped up to,uh,16th or possibly 15th today.Only 15% of their children were reading at or above grade level when the program was initiated.Today,about 65% are reading at or above grade level.They've made tremendous progress in almost any measure you'd want to look at.

**spk_0:** [09:56.69 - 10:05.58] Well,are you telling me that in this particular district,They have about 150 small schools of just 100 or 200 students.

**spk_2:** [10:05.92 - 10:34.88] There are about 50 schools,but all of the schools are very,very small.In fact,what you find there in these large and personal,uh,public school buildings of yesteryear,you find a number of very,very small,uh,uh,schools.In fact,one of the junior high schools that I visited,uh.At 5 different floors in the building and actually 5 different schools,very,very different,uh,so the parents actually really do have options,uh,to choose from.Well,

**spk_0:** [10:34.93 - 10:54.18] when you talk about relating to the parents and involving the parents in the school,I can't think of anything more important than letting them choose which school the child goes to.Absolutely.Well,tell us something about the uh conferences that you just had across the country.Didn't you have about 6 dozen conferences on choice in different cities?

**spk_2:** [10:54.43 - 12:07.01] That's correct.We,uh,we started in East Harlem.We tried to go to places where,uh,uh,people could actually see,uh,programs in operation.We held 5 of them.We generally had 750 to as many as about 1100 people in attendance.Each of the strategy sessions,uh,took on a personality of its own.We expected them to be regional,but almost every one of them turned into national meetings because we would have people from 30 to 35,uh,states present.Uh,one of the,uh.People had the opportunity not just to learn about choice but to hear from people who had,uh,been successfully,uh,implementing programs,uh,uh,to,to learn a,a variety of,uh,information about the various facets,uh,obstacles that they might face,and,uh.I was struck,uh,even following the first meeting with the fact that we had people who came to those meetings,many of them even skeptical of the idea,and left.Persuaded that this is something that they ought to seriously look at.

**spk_0:** [12:07.53 - 12:13.92] Did you find that some of the NEA members came in with hostility to argue against it?

**spk_2:** [12:14.09 - 12:43.60] Well,we had a variety of people,not just from,NEA membership that that.Uh,were arguing against,uh,choice and in some,some cases were,uh,hostile,but we also had in some of those other settings we had,uh,uh,teachers and even,uh,some state NEA leadership that came and were supportive,so that was not even uniform from side to side,although in every,uh,case the debate was very,very healthy,and yes we had people who were,uh,vehemently opposed to the idea.

**spk_0:** [12:44.26 - 12:46.47] Where were the locations of those meetings?

**spk_2:** [12:46.91 - 12:57.05] East Harlem,uh,we were in Minneapolis,Minnesota,Charlotte,North Carolina,Denver,Colorado,and then Richmond,California.

**spk_0:** [12:58.50 - 13:04.48] Did Governor Perpich of Minnesota come to your conference?Isn't the Choice program in Minnesota his pet project?

**spk_2:** [13:04.86 - 13:24.06] It is,and yes,uh,Governor Per was there for more than just a ceremonial appearance.He was there not constantly,but,uh,almost constantly throughout the,uh,the two days.He was very,very much,uh,involved and very,very supportive of the,the strategy sessions.

**spk_0:** [13:24.21 - 13:31.23] Well,it seems to me his involvement shows that this issue is not a conservative liberal issue.Isn't he known to be a liberal?

**spk_2:** [13:31.79 - 13:50.41] Absolutely,and,uh,there's,there's a lot of evidence that,uh,uh,that's really true.I mean the fact that,uh,uh,not just Minnesota,but,uh,also Arkansas has now adopted a state level policy again under the leadership of uh.Uh,liberal Democrat.

**spk_0:** [13:51.12 - 14:08.38] Well,we're talking to Ted Sanders,Undersecretary of Education,about the subject of parental choice in public schools,and stay with us.We'll be back in a couple of minutes.And then I'd like to ask Secretary Sanders if he thinks that choice in public education is the wave of the future.

**spk_1:** [14:08.55 - 14:44.27] And there's the well-known voice of constitutional lawyer and author of 12 books,syndicated columnist and radio.Commentator P Phyllis-Schlafly.Indeed,what does choice actually mean in education today?We're hearing the views of Undersecretary of Education,and we will continue with Ted Sanders and other guests coming up on the program that's helping to let you know what's really happening in the public schools today.This issue and many issues on Phyllis-Schlafly Live from the USA Radio Network.Stay with us.

**spk_3:** [14:58.84 - 16:00.70] You know Phy Phyllis-Schlafly.Her radio commentaries have been informing you on a wide variety of topics for many years.Her weekly program Radio Live with Phyllis-Schlafly gives you new insight into the world of education.Perhaps you've been able to attend her speaking engagements.She has spoken in all 50 states.Now you can enjoy her factual and eloquent presentations in your own home through audio cassettes.One of her best speeches,The Miracle of the Constitution,was given in 1987 and was officially recognized by the Commission on the Bicentennial of the US Constitution.Get this stirring address for your own cassette library.Buy a copy to share with your children and grandchildren.It will never go out of date as long as we live under the United States Constitution.Order the Miracle of the Constitution for $5 from Eagle-Forum.Write Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That address is Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_4:** [16:05.89 - 17:01.48] The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,a place where the most powerful man in the world resides,the president of the United States.But what many Americans don't know is that some of our nation's most important decisions aren't made in the Oval Office.Because according to the Constitution,the power to make laws was granted only to Congress and not to the president.That's why only Congress can declare war,raise and support armies,and approve treaties.The bill is passed.The Constitution,the words we live by.To receive a free copy of this great document and information about it,write Constitution,Washington DC 200063999.A message from the commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution and the Advertising Council.

**spk_1:** [17:02.73 - 17:10.43] Choice in education today.We're talking about it on the USA Radio Network on the program known as Philly Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [17:10.73 - 18:00.64] We're talking to Ted Sanders,Undersecretary of Education,about one of the great initiatives of the education president,George Bush.Uh,Ted,I want.I ask you this question uh the American people pay for Medicare and Medicaid,uh,but the people who get the benefits are not required to use a government hospital or a government doctor.You can pick your hospital and pick your doctor.And uh now the taxpayers also pay for food stamps for the needy,but you don't have to spend those food stamps at a government grocery store or take government selected or approved food items now uh don't you think it ought to be the same way in education we pay for education,but you have to go to the school that the government tells you to go to or you don't get any benefits.What do you think about that?

**spk_2:** [18:02.14 - 19:09.08] I,I would agree with you.Uh,however,in,in the case of,uh,public schools,what we have is a situation where the,uh,federal contribution is only at about 6 to 7% of the total financial support.That's the reason why in our strategy that we've taken the debate about the broad range of options that are available,which would include,uh,uh,private school options too to our strategy meetings around the country because the The decision makers there are really,uh,people that reside in state houses who are eventually going to determine what approach uh will be taken and in fact,as a,as a,a part of the discussions,uh.We looked at,uh,and had presented,uh,legislation that's being introduced,for example,uh,in the state of Wisconsin by,uh,uh,a legislator there who would really,at least in a limited sense,empower,uh,inner city,uh,minority parents to,to choose between and among schools with state,uh,and local financial support,including private schools.

**spk_0:** [19:09.88 - 19:25.20] Oh,that's right.You and the Department of Education cannot enforce choice or require competition.All you can do is,is say we're having a conference and putting on some speakers to say this is a nifty idea you ought to look at if you're state legislators or school board members.

**spk_2:** [19:25.37 - 19:27.61] That's correct.We can promote the idea.Uh,

**spk_0:** [19:27.86 - 19:46.28] I note that the conference that was put on by the department.Uh,just before Ronald Reagan left office,I think it was about the last thing he did,and both President Reagan and,and soon to be President Bush were there,and I said,were you there?That was before you came aboard

**spk_2:** [19:46.28 - 19:51.32] when that meeting took place,so I was.Able to be present for it.Although,well,

**spk_0:** [19:51.38 - 20:03.27] I noticed that President Reagan did say that choice in education is the wave of the future,and it's the most exciting thing that's going on in education today.Do you think we're continuing with that momentum?Oh,

**spk_2:** [20:03.38 - 20:31.96] absolutely.Ah,it is the wave of the future.We're going to,we're going to see great movement towards choice,I believe,uh,in the schools of America just like we're seeing taking place over in the Eastern bloc in Europe today in an economic sense,it's going to happen to America's schools in the 90s.Uh,President Bush,uh,firmly believes that choice is the cornerstone.For restructuring America's failing schools.

**spk_0:** [20:32.12 - 20:34.72] In other words,perestroika in public schools.

**spk_2:** [20:34.86 - 20:35.48] That's right.Well,

**spk_0:** [20:35.60 - 20:43.92] do you think that competition is probably the biggest benefit of it,and a lot of us in America believe that competition produces a better product.

**spk_2:** [20:44.12 - 21:59.73] I think that the market discipline that comes from opening choices,yes,contributes to success.You can see it in the schools where we've been.In fact,I think there are really 3 things that make it work.You can't discount the greater involvement that parents feel once they have some kind of power in the decision making process with their children.I saw across this country parents who,uh,uh,not only made the decision about where to send their child but literally were deeply involved in the school.The school had had opened its doors to them too,and they were there,uh,working in a variety of ways and supporting,uh.Ah,their child's education,but there is a,a companion,uh,piece that happens too,uh,uh,in every,uh,instance,uh,where we've looked at programs,and that is,uh,the,uh,faculty that works in a school under a strong leadership in every case,uh,uh,has,is also empowered,uh,somewhat like parents to create very diverse,uh,Kinds of learning opportunities for students.They're,they're allowed to to make schools unique and to literally work for kids,uh.

**spk_0:** [22:01.22 - 22:10.55] Well,tell us some of the reasons why people oppose it.It sounds like a great idea to me,but I know there are people who oppose it.What are some of the reasons they advance?

**spk_2:** [22:10.74 - 23:14.18] Well,I,I tell you,the sense that I picked up from the regional strategy meetings,which is really a reinforcement of past experiences too,is that for the most part it's a,a skeptical establishment who,who,who really is,uh,leery of,uh,I guess most any change.They want to preserve the status quo and,uh,are not anxious to,uh.Ah,to change,even though they recognize in many cases that,that,uh,schools are,are failing,uh,one of the other arguments that we,uh,that we heard as we were,uh,uh,moving across the country is that,uh,uh,choice would literally,uh,uh,resegregate,uh,the schools of America,which is really a very interesting argument itself because,uh,choice plans have been used in many locations to.To,uh,uh,further desegregate schools.In fact,that's the prime motivation behind the,the federal,uh,magnet schools money,and it's been used very effectively for that purpose.

**spk_0:** [23:14.92 - 23:43.48] Now I should emphasize that we're really talking about choice in public schools,but there are a lot of people when you talk about choice in education,they think of it in terms as choice to choose a private school too,uh,without the financial detriment of having to pay for tax supported schools and also then pay tuition in the private school.And at this time you're not,you're not promoting choice to private schools,right?

**spk_2:** [23:44.69 - 24:25.78] Well,What we promoted across the country was the broad debate which would even include the possibility of aid to private schools.Yes,that was very much a part of the discussion,uh,in each of the regional strategy meetings,uh,and in fact,uh,interesting to note after we held the uh regional strategy meeting in Richmond,California,which is now about 2.5 years into the implementation of their choice plan.Uh,their superintendent,uh,uh,Doctor Marks announced,uh,a proposal that he was taking that would extend choice in that district to private schools.

**spk_0:** [24:26.42 - 24:43.45] Would that be along the lines of the plan they have in Vermont?Are you familiar,uh,with the way Vermont,uh,since,oh,for 100 years,I think,has done what they call tuitioning students,uh,to private schools when they don't have a local public school available.

**spk_2:** [24:43.98 - 25:09.48] Uh,I think,uh,I think what Doctor Mars Marks is proposing,and I haven't seen the full details of his program,is even beyond,uh,uh,just an option whenever,uh,there's not a,a public school available.If I,if I understood correctly from the clip that I saw,uh,Walter Marks is proposing,uh,opening,uh,generally the choices to parents to include both public and private.And uh well,

**spk_0:** [25:09.56 - 25:12.39] how would the funding,how would the funding go on that?

**spk_2:** [25:12.63 - 25:29.62] Well,I would assume that the local district uh would enter into some kind of a tuition agreement with the private schools to make that work and so that uh.The dollars available to that district would,would be able to flow on in and support programs in the private schools.

**spk_0:** [25:29.85 - 25:39.01] A moment ago you mentioned that there were discussions in Wisconsin about including private schools in the choice plan.Do you,uh,what are the details on that?

**spk_2:** [25:39.17 - 26:24.89] Well,it's a very interesting idea because,uh,it grows out of a legislative district in Milwaukee where the local legislator.Uh,has come to recognize that the,the schools where her children and,and other parents' children attend in that district are,are literally,uh,uh,failing,and,uh,even if you were to provide open enrollment to those children to other public schools,there would not be other successful public schools available to them.And so what she is proposing that,uh,uh,parents of children in those failing schools be allowed to.Receive a voucher if you please and go redeem it even in the private schools of their choice.

**spk_0:** [26:25.51 - 26:37.60] Well,that's a very exciting promotion of the idea of competition.Do you know of any other place where that is in,in place except Vermont at the present time?

**spk_2:** [26:37.77 - 26:56.56] No,I don't other than to say.That is basically our system of higher education.Uh,that's the only place in this country where I think you can go and take a look at,uh,uh.Uh,a system where It is a system of choice and we're and

**spk_0:** [26:56.56 - 27:02.40] it's worked very well in higher education.I mean I can start out with the GI Bill of Rights after World War II.

**spk_2:** [27:03.44 - 27:04.74] We're the envy of the world.

**spk_0:** [27:06.27 - 28:00.17] Well,um,if you believe that competition will improve the product that's turned out of the schools,certainly the widest area of choice would be the best situation.Oh well,I,I hope you can keep using your bully pulpit for this.I,I realize that you can't enforce this,but it could be,it could become something that is so attractive that the public will demand it.Absolutely.Well,we certainly do thank you,Ted Sanders,Undersecretary of Education,for visiting with us on this program and for explaining in more detail.The whole idea of choice,I must say it has,it has not had a great deal of publicity.Maybe it did in those areas where you had those conferences,but most people don't even know that this exists,and we're very glad to bring these ideas to a wider audience and,and we wish you well and thank you for joining us today.Phyllis.

**spk_1:** [28:00.18 - 28:08.55] I enjoyed hearing from Ted Sanders.Exactly what is your group Eagle-Forum doing to further choice in education?

**spk_1:** [29:56.02 - 30:04.32] Welcome back to the USA Radio Network's presentation of Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and this week we're talking about choice in education.

**spk_0:** [30:04.66 - 30:37.00] Our next guest today is David Hanson,who was a teacher and administrator for 27 years in education.He served 2 4-year terms on the Nevada State Board of Education and also was on the board of directors of the Far West Laboratory of the US Department of Education.Are you there,David Hanson?I am Phyllis.How are you?We've been talking about the subject.of introducing choice in education,the US Department has held conferences across the country.It's one of President Bush's initiatives,and I understand you may have some thoughts on this subject.

**spk_5:** [30:37.36 - 30:55.15] I certainly do.I think that the voucher system is long overdue,and I think that when we ask the questions for whom do schools exist.And what should be done?The question is,schools should exist for students and parents and taxpayers,and with the voucher system,it would make it such.

**spk_0:** [30:55.51 - 31:03.37] Well,when you say voucher system,are you talking about the choice to move around among the public schools or public and private?

**spk_5:** [31:03.55 - 31:27.65] I advocate the type of voucher suggested by Milton Freedom,which is called the universal unregulated voucher,which means that a An individual receives a voucher,and I,I don't know if you've already talked about what a voucher is.It's a credit given by the government that provides money for education to a student,and it may be used at any approved organization,and that would mean a public,parochial or private school.

**spk_0:** [31:28.50 - 31:35.29] Well,I think parents would certainly welcome that.Would this be a,a real voucher,a piece of paper they'd have in their hands?

**spk_5:** [31:35.77 - 31:41.50] It definitely would.It would be a voucher representing cash,and how

**spk_0:** [31:41.50 - 31:42.66] much cash per student?

**spk_5:** [31:42.76 - 32:09.30] Uh,it is indicated,in starting the voucher systems that different states have level of funding and within a given state.Uh,since we are on a state educational system,uh,set up in the United States,that each,uh,state has a per a per pupil amount that they spend on students,and let's say here in Nevada for example,it,it amounts to $4500 the parent would be given a voucher for that amount to be spent at the school of their choice.

**spk_0:** [32:09.58 - 32:14.83] And so if they went to a private school where the tuition were 5500 dollars,

**spk_5:** [32:14.84 - 32:16.44] then they would have to make up the difference.Uh-huh.

**spk_0:** [32:17.41 - 32:20.27] And do you know of any place where this has been tried?

**spk_5:** [32:21.08 - 32:34.24] This is currently going on on a limited scale in Minnesota.Governor Rudy Purpich managed to get this through over the objection of the NEA and it is and that

**spk_0:** [32:34.25 - 32:41.17] that shows that it can be done by the liberals since Governor Perridge is generally known to be a liberal rather than conservative.

**spk_5:** [32:41.27 - 32:47.43] It's,it can be done by those who want education for our children.I think he's one of those people.

**spk_0:** [32:47.52 - 33:06.98] However,the Minnesota plan,I don't believe any piece of paper goes into the hands of the parents.I think it's simply the,the parent can elect to transfer his child to another public school and then through manipulation of the budget,the funding follows the child.Isn't that the way it works?

**spk_5:** [33:07.30 - 33:14.71] It is.It's,it is a voucher system,but it is not an open voucher system per se.But let's put it this way,it's a big foot in the door.

**spk_0:** [33:16.05 - 33:33.63] That's right.I,uh,there are some people who look upon this choice in public education as antithetical to giving people choice in private education,uh,but,uh,I see it as a step forward because anything that would introduce competition would improve the result.

**spk_5:** [33:34.01 - 33:51.45] Well,that's definitely what we need is uh competition,of course,uh,the NEA,the union that has the largest war chest in the United States,is certainly.a factor in getting any type of program that allows a redistribution of political power and economic power back to the people and the consumers.

**spk_0:** [33:51.69 - 34:09.28] Now they've passed resolutions at their national convention opposing any kind of choice plan.They certainly have with their million dollar budget,100.dollars budget and $7 million that they spend on political and lobbying activities,they're working against it all the way,

**spk_5:** [34:09.51 - 34:34.05] you know,Phyllis,one thing that's very interesting is that in the latest statistics that I have,Catholic and private schools,although the teachers in those schools may or may not be certified.Uh,in many cases,um,the results of the student tests indicate that students in those private and parochial schools do better than the students in public schools where all the teachers are certified and,uh,regulated essentially by the NEA,along with the government.

**spk_0:** [34:34.63 - 34:49.90] Well,there's another factor in the cost of course the private schools usually cost a great deal less per pupil,but isn't one of the primary reasons for that the different ratio of teachers to administrators?Do you have any figures on that?

**spk_5:** [34:50.23 - 35:29.51] I don't have the uh the administrator to teacher ratio.However,I can tell you one thing that uh.Uh,many times,um,in private schools because of costs,um,classes,especially this is true in parochial schools,uh,the pupil teacher ratio is higher.But what's interesting once again from another country,in Japan,the average class is 39,and the NEA keeps harping and calling for more money to reduce the class size,which is an average of 23 here in America.And yet when we compare the outcomes of education,the students in Japan in classes of 39 score much better than our students do.

**spk_0:** [35:29.95 - 35:43.17] Well,there isn't any empirical evidence,is,is there,to show that reducing class size from,say,23 to 20 or 18 would make any difference.It would just cost a lot more money and require hiring more teachers.

**spk_5:** [35:43.23 - 35:50.53] But that's of course what the NEA keeps hollering for.And if we introduce the voucher system where there was competition,that is another problem that would be eliminated.

**spk_0:** [35:51.02 - 36:06.82] On the administrator question,I've seen some figures that show that the public schools in places like Chicago and New York have something like 40 times more administrators per pupil than the public schools.Well,you can see what that does to cost.

**spk_5:** [36:07.27 - 36:11.49] It can certainly be top heavy if uh if the bureaucrats have their way.

**spk_0:** [36:12.40 - 36:21.28] Well,tell us more about what you called Milton Friedman's universal unregulated voucher.Define that a little more.I,

**spk_5:** [36:21.36 - 37:49.79] I think the best way to to talk about this is to compare it to things that people know about.For example,the GI Bill of Rights.That was essentially a voucher system in that any individual who had served in the military at a certain point in time.Uh was credited by the government with 4 years of education,and they could go to a Catholic school,they could go to a technical school,they could go to a private school,they could go to a state university and spend that money where they wanted.And what's interesting is that of course these people utilized their own knowledge and capability to choose a school and got the education that they wanted,and it worked.Uh,also,uh,another form of voucher is the food stamp voucher.When the government gives,uh,a food stamp to someone,they don't say spend it at Safeway or spend it at 7-Eleven stores.An individual has the right to take it to any store that they want and spend it.And one more example,Medicare.An individual who is on Medicare,which again is a voucher from the government,can go to a,um,a private hospital,a public hospital,or one that is associated with some religion.And essentially this is what we're talking about a voucher,universal and regulated.If a person had a voucher,they could take that to any school that they chose and to pay for the education of their students.And that way the school is forced into competition with all other schools for those students that are available for education.Well,

**spk_0:** [37:49.88 - 38:25.95] I would hope that one of the results of this would be there would be some schools that would teach basic skills and fundamentals.And I understand there is a school like this in Mesa,Arizona,the Benjamin Franklin School,uh,which is an old fashioned type basic skills,uh,tough discipline school,and,uh,and some parents,uh,can put their children in that school,uh,if they want to,but they line up to get permission to go into that school,uh,but there is no others,uh,there is such a demand that the school district ought to provide.Other schools like that,but they won't do it.

**spk_5:** [38:26.10 - 38:58.75] Well,see,on the voucher system,the people would demand that this sort of service be given or they would take their school vouchers to other schools that would provide this.So competition,just like when the government broke up Ma Bell,the big telephone system,we found that competition lowered rates,the competition improved service,and the same thing would happen as it has in education,as it has in business.And the interesting thing is here we are,a capitalistic.Society and yet we allow the government to have a monopoly in education.It doesn't make sense.

**spk_0:** [38:58.99 - 39:25.94] That's what David Carnes of IBM,I think,calls a failed monopoly.And indeed it is.Well,we thank you very much,David Hanson,from your 27 years' experience with the public school system for sharing your thoughts about the universal unregulated voucher so that parents can have choice in education.Thank you.We.Appreciate you joining us and uh we'll be back shortly with another guest on Choice.

**spk_1:** [39:26.28 - 39:36.03] Indeed,uh,real quickly,how many calls would you say you get in a month at the Eagle-Forum Education Advisory Center regarding this specific matter,choice in education,

**spk_0:** [39:36.21 - 39:45.39] Phyllis?Well,we get calls from parents who want choice,who want something other than what they're forced to take in their local public schools.Stay with us.

**spk_1:** [39:45.57 - 39:49.41] Stay with us.We're talking about it here on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_1:** [41:54.06 - 42:04.47] Reforms in education today giving parents the right to choose the public school their children attend and we're scrutinizing the issue on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [42:04.75 - 43:05.92] We've been talking today about choice in public schools,that is giving parents the right to select what schools their children go to.Uh,Ronald Reagan called it the wave of the future.Uh,we've talked earlier with Undersecretary of Education Ted Sanders and with,uh,another,uh,educator.In Nevada who's very interested in this subject.And now we have on the line Tom Tancredo of Denver.Uh,he also has been years and years in education,a former member of the Colorado legislature who then chaired the Education Committee,and now for the last,I guess some 5 years,he's been the regional representative for the US Department of Education in Denver.Hello,Tom,are you there?Hello,Phyllis.Yes,I am.Well,thank you for joining us today.It's my pleasure.Uh,I understand that one of these choice conferences that was put on in the last couple of months by the Department of Education was held in Denver.So why don't you give us,uh,your viewpoint on the conference and on the whole idea of giving parents choice?

**spk_8:** [43:06.38 - 44:56.83] Um,I'll be happy to.Um,as you may recall,Phyllis,this is an issue.Education choice is an issue with which,um,this office,and,and in fact I personally have been involved for a long time.When I was in the Colorado legislature way back when.1976,I guess it was,I introduced a bill,um,for a voucher system,which is of course a significantly more an expanded,ah,ah,choice opportunity that we're talking about right now,but,um,so it is one with which,ah,I have been involved for a long time and I have been very pleased to see the development of the idea and the acceptance of the concept is now,um,I think at the majority state,and that is something that's really quite amazing.Um,the department,uh,uh,and the Secretary of Education Laurel Cavazos determined that in order to sort of speed up the process of,of getting people involved with the idea of choice and,and letting them know how important it,uh,it could be as a reform issue,uh,they determined to hold 5,hearings around the United States.The first one was in East Harlem,New York,because That's a place where public schools of choice have really and truly taken hold and changed an entire district around.It has gone from the,uh,the last place in the 30 among the 32 districts in New York to now,uh,a 16th,you know,it's not the best,but it's certainly come a long way,and it has done so as a result of giving people,parents,students,teachers,and administrators the opportunity to choose the kind of schools in which they want to be every day.We held the 4th of the series of 5 meetings here in Denver,and before I go on,let me say how much I appreciate the efforts of a lot of your ladies and friends of mine here in Colorado,Eagle-Forum members who helped us,who,

**spk_0:** [44:57.07 - 45:00.77] well,they're very interested in education and especially in choice in education.

**spk_8:** [45:00.99 - 45:54.82] Yes,they are,and they did a great job.A lot of them worked volunteers on the,on the.The conference itself,and there were literally scores of them in the audience.I know,um,the first night we had over 1000 people at George Washington High School,and that is the most that attended any conference up to that point in time.The next day there was the,the,um,that was,by the way,that conference or that evening at George Washington was billed as a parents speak to the secretary night,and in the,did they,did they ever?They did not hold back a bit,and it was really quite exhilarating because I think 99% of the comments were positive with regard to choice.And I also think that that was not the case in some of the other regions where the opponents of choice,

**spk_0:** [45:55.06 - 45:56.82] you mean like the,like the

**spk_8:** [45:56.82 - 45:57.30] NEA,

**spk_0:** [45:57.66 - 45:57.88] exactly.

**spk_8:** [45:58.05 - 46:28.35] Well,the NEA,I lump them all together.I talk about the education establishment because of course you've got teachers' unions,but you've also got administrators' unions and you've got PTA groups and school board organizations that unfortunately march to the same tune as the NEA.And so they marshaled their forces and were really able to,I think,monopolize the conversation in a couple of the other regions where the,where the conference was held.

**spk_0:** [46:28.43 - 46:30.77] But,but in Denver you had a real debate

**spk_8:** [46:31.64 - 47:57.45] exactly,and I think the Secretary,well,I know the Secretary was pleased.The next day was the conference itself.I mean when we had the,it's a traditional type of conference breakout sessions,and Plenary sessions and speakers and that sort of thing and,and we've gotten literally,oh,I,I would bet well over 100 responses already from people,calls and letters from people who have,who have indicated their,uh,their excitement,uh,about the conference and how much they got out of it.I got a call the other day,yesterday I guess it was,from a lady who is the head of the accountability Committee for the city of Denver,school district of Denver.And I mean in Denver,and she said that up until that time she had never really been much of a supporter,but because she was able to talk to folks from East Harlem and from places around the United States where choice was in operation and see the excitement that they,uh,exhibited when they talked about schools and see how children were learning.As a result of being able to pick from a wider variety of opportunities,she said,I am now a believer,and I'm going to move this board in that direction.Well,of course that's exactly what we had hoped would happen,that by rubbing shoulders with people who were actually doing it,where it's no longer just a concept,Phyllis,where they have put it into action,and,and see that it can and does work,choice works.

**spk_0:** [47:57.95 - 48:17.86] It's such an American value,as Ronald Reagan said at the first conference on this.It's the,it represents a return to some of the most basic American values.Just suppose the people in the East had to buy a General Motors car and the people in the Midwest a Ford car and the people in the West a Chrysler car just because of where you live.That's the way the school system is.

**spk_8:** [48:18.11 - 48:58.20] Exactly.It's,it's the one of the strongest,um,I guess one of the.Best examples of a socialistic enterprise that we still have in the United States.It's a monopolistic enterprise run by the government.It,it tells you essentially where,where you,you know,what would we do if,um,in the,let's say,food stamp area,you know,the government determines that it has a responsibility to help people out who are in need.And so they provide food stamps.Well,we don't also build the grocery store,stock it,and hire all the help,and then tell you that's the store you've got to go to in order to trade in your food stamps.We say go out in the marketplace and buy the best food you,and that's

**spk_0:** [48:58.20 - 49:07.28] what we ought to do in education,and we thank you,Tom Tancre.From Denver for joining us on this program.We hope we'll hear more about choice in the future,and Phyllis

**spk_1:** [49:07.28 - 49:20.16] will need some closing perspective and glad you could take some time out of your holiday schedule to lend us an ear.Choice and education on the USA Radio Network's presentation of Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_7:** [49:24.99 - 50:25.06] Eagle-Forum has been a leader in America's pro-family movement since 1972,you see.Eagle-Forum stands for traditional family values.One way we support the family is that we push for laws and taxes that encourage mothers to care for their own children and encourage fathers to provide for them.All too often we've felt the liberal agenda of laws and taxes that impose disincentives on the roles of mother and father.Let's face it,a child's place is in the home.We'll continue to work hard for our traditional family values because we believe strongly that preschool children need their parents' loving care,not government care.How about becoming a part of our team?Our team of 80,000 men and women is growing,and you can be a part.Of a team that stands for pro-family values.Write us today for a membership application.Just send $15 to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.

**spk_3:** [50:25.43 - 51:23.09] Informing the public about real issues in education today,that's the job of Radio Live with Phyllis-Schlafly.But we need your help.Encourage your friends to listen to the program and thank this station for carrying it.Get your friends a cassette copy of this program.Give a subscription of the education reporter to your church or child's teacher,and don't forget about our packets that accompany information discussed on the program each week.Packets are available for $10 each on topics such as AIDS education,sex education,new age education,drug education,Quest,the NEA,and more.Send $5 for cassettes and $10 for packets to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Remember to specify the date of the program and topic when you order.That's $5 for cassettes and $10 for packets to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.

**spk_0:** [51:23.82 - 52:02.95] Choice in education means letting parents select which public school they want to send their children to.Ronald Reagan has called this the wave of the future because it represents a return to basic American values.Conservatives like the idea because they see choice as a way to break up the failed monopoly of the public school system.Liberals like it because they see it as a way to let the poor have the same opportunity for a good education as the well-to do.The question is not why have choice in education,but why not.It's an idea whose time has come.Write us,if you'd like a packet on choice.
