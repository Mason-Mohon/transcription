**spk_0:** [00:00.48 - 00:09.74] The new reading test given to all schoolchildren in Michigan is a fraud.Instead of testing reading skills,it just tests opinions and attitudes.

**spk_1:** [00:11.49 - 00:34.71] Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.This is Bruce Hayes inviting you to stay with us for the next hour because we're going to shed a lot of light on this matter.And of course,your telephone calls will be welcomed at 1-800-736-3202.Phyllis,I hear that the July issue of your Eagle Forum's education reporter,it stirred up quite a hornet's nest out in Michigan.Uh,what's it all about?

**spk_0:** [00:34.84 - 01:30.17] That's right,Bruce.We ran a big news story on the new Michigan Educational Assessment Program,which is a reading test that the state of Michigan is giving to all public school children in the 4th,7th,and 10th grades.The test is going on right now.They call it the MEAEP test.That stands for Michigan Educational Assessment Program.And we printed criticisms of parents and teachers and dozens of actual test questions.We also printed some of the stupid stories that were on the test,and anybody could read the questions and see for yourself that the test does not test reading skills,uh,but it,it asks for opinions and attitudes of the child,and even some of the questions,uh,were asked before.The student read the story.So as a result,the state legislators called a hearing,and we're going to have a guest on our program today who attended that hearing and has been following this issue in Michigan.

**spk_1:** [01:30.34 - 01:57.05] And the guest is Betty Lewis of Flushing,Michigan,chairman of the Michigan Alliance for Families,active in education matters,you know,for quite some time,and our listeners will definitely want to get in on this conversation,Probably have lots of questions.So before we go to Betty,let me give out that telephone number from anywhere in America.Get in now while you can because lines are open at 1-800-736-3202.Phyllis,here's Betty Lewis on the line.

**spk_0:** [01:57.35 - 14:12.30] Hello,Betty.Thank you for joining us today.Well,first tell us about that hearing that the state legislature had on the new reading test put out by MEP.Ah,the hearing came about because we had taken your newsletter along with other information and delivered it to all the senators and reps in the Capitol,and with it by 2:30 that afternoon they had,uh,requested Doctor Donovan,who is assistant superintendent for research and evaluation of the Department of Ed,to,ah,come before the House Education Committee and explain the MEP.Ah,that day when he was there to explain the MEP,none of us were allowed to even address the subject,which we were very upset with.You mean he was the only witness at the hearing?He was the only witness along with Peggy Deutcher of the Department of Ed,who is one of the main individuals going around the state promoting the ME test,very involved with the MEP.Well,were you present?Did you hear what they had to say?Yes,in fact,we actually taped everything we had,that Doctor.Donovan had to say,so we had proof of what the man was saying.And,and how did he defend this test?Well,he defended it in,in all areas,and there were several things really strange.He was there to discuss the MEP,yet he held up the paper and he said,Well,here's a paper,and we don't know where it's come from or who it's come from.And,and all I can say,Phyllis,it was the paper that was the vehicle to expose this horrible test throughout the state of Michigan and I think nationwide.The other thing of real interest was he said at that time that any parent requesting their child to be excused,that they were telling them they could be excused from taking the test.And yet,well,that's a switch.They had been trying to make it mandatory,hadn't they?Right?And the interesting thing is after he made this statement,I was on a talk show,uh,one day this,this week,and I told the,the listening audience this very thing,and one,parent called Doctor Donovan's office,and he said,oh yes,we said they could be excused on religious purposes.So he is actually trying to build up a case that the only ones complaining about,ah,this test is.The religious far right because,as he explained that day,one of the problems with the test and the one story about the rummage sale,it's so bad,ah,he said,well,this one woman went to the,the,the school,and after she viewed the test,she apologized.She said,you know,I'd been told in my church that this was actually promoting abortion,and,ah,so he made it look as if this was,was something being done by just a,a far right group that was just making a molehill,a mountain.Well,of course that's not true at all.Our news story showed,uh,that the objections that parents raised were that this is not a reading test at all.It had nothing to do with religion.We want our children to learn the skills of reading.Ah,explain to our listeners why this test is not.A reading test.Well,the reason that this test cannot be considered a reading reading test is because really,Phyllis,there are no right or wrong answers.Um,one couple taking the test,a husband and a wife that went in and looked at it,they took the test and they came up with entirely different answers.So tell me,how can it be evaluated?This is what,how do they answer that question when you ask them?Well,the thing,the funny part of it is,see,one part they're grading and another part they're not,and yet when you ask this question they just waltz all around the issue and never come up with a tangible answer.You know their educational jargon that they use.Well,yes,of course.Well,did you,ah,what do you feel about the questions being value related or,or inquiring into the pupils?Attitudes or opinions or beliefs or values.There can be no doubt that that's what this is all about.In fact,when my own minister learned that this was being given in some of the Christian schools here in Genesee County,he and his wife took the test because I happen to have my copy,and they took the test,and what he said was missing in the test was really a choice of an answer coming from the Christian point of view.I think that's very interesting,um.Well,but it has nothing to do with whether you're a Christian or not a Christian as to whether you can read certain words on the page.That's the issue.That's the whole issue.And of course this is what he was trying to say.Why do we give this kind of a test in a Christian school when really there's no Christian values?It has nothing to do with reading.In fact,after I did the talk show,I was called by one Christian school in the state of Michigan,and they said after we heard you,we went and Read the test and we decided then we are not giving that test to our students.Well,are you telling us that the state officials were trying to get the private schools,the Christian schools,to use this same test that they were giving to the public schools?Yes,and sorry to say many of the private schools were falling for it hook,line,and sinker because they wanted to show the stu the state how well their,ah,private schools were doing teaching the children.And of course this is being fed in big data.And they're not,they're not even aware of this.What a means of,of moving in on the Christian schools or any private school if this child isn't developing the preconceived attitudes the state wants the child to develop.Well,it does appear,uh,from the questions that we published in the Education Reporter that,uh,the,the purpose of the questions was really to disguise the fact that the student really wasn't reading.The particular words,uh,in other words,ah,the student might be able to answer the questions from his general knowledge or even from the picture on the page.Is that what you found?Yes,in fact,in this year's test,um,they're in each grade level,4th,7th,and 10th grade,on each test there is one question that can only be answered if the child looks at the pictures.It can be answered in no other way.Well,tell me,how does that test reading?Well,it doesn't.That's,that's the thing,and Superintendent of Public Instruction BMA,he said it will major higher order thinking skills.And see,this is what I said two years ago.This was the NAEP inferential testing or higher order thinking skills.Well,I don't consider this thinking skills unless they're,they're saying a child must develop the right attitude as far as the answers are concerned.BAS also said this assesses the student's knowledge,skills,and attitudes.It Looks at the whole and you know that's,that's the problem I think we as parents have and taxpayers,yes,it's looking at the whole and that is not the business of the public schools.Well,when we send a child to school to learn how to read,the only attitude that's really important is the attitude that I want to learn how to read the print on the page,because if the child can't learn how to read,then he will fall farther behind every year,and,uh,that's a cause,a principal cause of dropout.Later on,well,uh,Betty,tell us,ah,ah,some of the stories.Did you find the stories themselves objectionable?Oh.Well,give us an example of a story that you didn't like.Well,at the 4th grade level,the children are reading the story on the rumming sale.The mother is having a rumming sale and getting rid of some of the girls.And by the way,the only way you know it's a girl is to look at the pictures,getting rid of some of the girls' puzzles and books and toys to make room for the new baby.And the next thing you know,the girl is having her own rummage sale,and she's putting her baby brother up for sale.She has 3 people approach her on buying the baby.One doesn't want to buy it because it's the wrong gender.Another because it's too much money.Another woman says,Oh well,I wanted to buy an ironing board.But the mother ends up buying the.back and get at the rummage sale at the rummage sale,yes,and gives the child the money that she wanted to buy a special toy.Well,the girl ends up really good in that the girl finally realizes she does value her little brother and that he means something to her.But what are we planning in the minds of fourth graders?I mean,what a depressing story.Well,when you have a romance seal,it's to get rid of your junk.Do we put the connotation of junk on a baby?How depressing.Are there other depressing stories?Um,I think,uh,the,the other thing that bothers me is at the 7th grade level.Now at the 7th grade level,it's called cheating Mr.Diskin,and Mr.Diskin is an old,uh,you know,he's a rummage dealer,and so these boys have saved their tin foil,but they really don't have enough that weighs enough for them to be able to go to the show.So they take a stone and they wrap the tin foil around it and take it to Mr.Diskin to sell it,sell it to him to get the money to go to the show,and the one boy is having guilt feelings,but it ends up that Mr.Diskin comes up after going in his shed to measure it,and he holds out his hand,and he has 2 dimes and a stone,and he just shakes his head.Now what are some of the questions these boys are asked regarding this,this,you know,um,if Mr.Diskin had not noticed the trick,Rob would probably have felt nothing at all,sorry he had not used a bigger stone,bad about what he had done,lucky to have a friend like soup.Now you tell me what's the right answer,and is,what are we teaching our children that it's all right to,to cheat or steal if you can get away with it.You mean there is no ending to this story.Oh,and the idea that this is teaching reading skills is,is just really outrageous.And yet,uh,uh,I have heard that this Michigan test is going to be a model for the national reading test put out by the national assessment,uh,the one called NAEP.Have you heard that?Um,I have in my hand the Michigan Education Report.It's a publication,the State Board of Ed,and it reads that 4 passages.From the Michigan reading test were submitted to the International Association for Evaluation Educational Assessment.Ah,ah,submitted by whom?By the US Department of Ed.This is the first time they have taken existing items rather than developed new items,and they took all items from the Michigan Test for the international test.The other,um,of interest,it,it reads Michigan's new reading test is also being used as a model for test development.By the National Assessment of Educational Progress for the 1990 National Assessment of Reading.There it is.Well,Betty,do you think this ties in with the new theory of education that is supposed to be,uh,propagated by Michigan,uh,their use of the whole language approach to reading.In,in other words,would you say that,uh,the Department of Education making use of the Michigan questions,uh,would appear to be approval of the use of this method called whole language,which of course as we know is a very anti-phonics method of teaching reading?Well,this is definitely,there's no doubt,Phyllis,this is what it is because as I have done my research and I'm getting ready to do.My next newsletter on this,it's a,I am really appalled and amazed at what I am uncovering here.First of all,I discovered that Michigan's test was developed,um,at the Center for Study of Reading at the University of Illinois.I find that Doctor David Pearson,who is dean of the College of Education at the University of Illinois,is the one that's uh that's quoted extensive.an education read week regarding the Nate Boor is,is seeking a consensus on reading,and I find in materials here that he is quoted this,this same gentleman,this P.David Pearson,as this is the only way to move,ah,knowledge and experience an individual brings to reading are critical factors in comprehension.And so it's,it's,um,the,ah,NAEP article is very,very interesting because they quote him extensively.Well,I,um,I think it's just,ah,horrible to believe that the US Department of Education is putting its stamp of approval on the whole language method of reading,which is just teaching children a guessing game instead of teaching them to really read the words that are on the page.Ah,we're going to have to take a break now,Betty.We appreciate.For joining us.Uh,how about standing by and we'll see if some of our callers might want to ask you a question.Yeah,

**spk_0:** [16:57.01 - 22:02.30] Hello Jill.Have you been,uh,hearing this program about reading methods and reading tests in Michigan?Have you seen the test?I have.Oh,tell us your experience.Well,um,when I went in,I had,um,I had come to this through your newsletter about the meep and And I had questions about it,so I asked my,uh,um,junior high school,um,see if I could see the test,and the counselor was handle does handle the test.I guess all the counselors do this for the MEP,and he told me,no,I couldn't view the test.And I said,well,I gave him my reasons why I'd like to see the test because,um,I just like to look it over.I have some concerns and I don't want my son taking it for these concerns,and he told me that my son would take the test.And I said,Well,no,uh,Mr.So and so,he won't take the test unless I can view it.And he said that the meep was under security reasons,and I said,Oh,I understand.I said,um.I would come in an hour before the testing to view the test and then make my,my judgment if my son can take it or not,and he said no,that wouldn't be possible for me to do that.And once again he said my son would take the test that it was mandatory.Well,I told him he'd hear from me again,and since that time I had written the,uh,principal of the junior high and went,um,wrote a letter.And took it in and the principal was very surprised at what the counselor had said,and he said he would get back to me,which he did.I had my letter also witnessed by a friend.And I did state in the letter some of the laws and that I knew that the MEP was under federal funds and that I could view it and well,you know,yeah,you heard,uh,Betty Lewis say in the earlier part of this program that the assistant state superintendent said it was not mandatory that the students did not have to take it,right?I found that out afterwards.In fact,I did call Betty Lewis and she told me that,but that's what really got me going is when she,when the,uh,The counselor had said my son would take the test.In my view,I don't care if they're playing blacks.If I want to see this test concerning blacks,I should be able to as a parent to see it.And it is amazing the way some schools try to conceal the,the lessons,the curriculum,the activities from the parents.Yes,it is.And,but since that time I did view it in the test,I was,I hate to use the term,but blown away.It,uh,Especially the battery of testing at the end of the test,which more or less sounded to me they want the child to assess the meep test.Yeah,I thought those were pretty funny.They asked the,uh,the child to assess the test.Yes,and what are we paying the school personnel for exactly?And,and,um,within the test there was more than one answer,not even this battery of questions,but before that there,you mean there were some questions for which you could give,uh,several different answers and they would all be right.Exactly.And I know that they,I had asked the principal,is there one answer here?And he says,Oh yes.Well,that could be impossible.They weren't,they weren't testing the child for comprehension.It's,it's a joke.I mean,I,I had to giggle through it and because I thought it was so,I didn't mean that it was funny.I mean this is a very serious thing,but well,it is very serious that the schools are pretending to teach the children reading,but really they're playing games with a,a guessing method,a look at the pictures,a call on your own.general information in order to give your opinion about these questions.There was one,question at the end of the test if I can share it,and it was I had to laugh because the four answers for all the tests at the last battery was I agree.I strongly agree.Um,well,A was agree,B was strongly agree,C was disagree,and D was strongly disagree.And the question was,after you read this section,which was lengthy on,uh,families,uh,culture,nuclear families and such throughout,um,they asked the question,did you understand all the written word.Did you understand all the words in this section,and those were the four choices.Well,it didn't make any sense.No,it doesn't make any sense.What happened to yes or no.And anyway,they should have a question which reveals to the teacher whether the child did read the word or not.You don't ask the child whether he was able to read the word.You,you ask him,uh,to repeat the word or to write the word or to give some answer that shows that he read the word.But that was,it was just it.Well,so what happened,Jill?Did your child take the test?No,he did not.I,I didn't allow him,and they were very good with that.Um,they said that was fine.I had to write a brief,um,letter saying that I did not want my child to take the test,and I wrote in there why.And I do have to say the principal was very good,you know,after I stood my ground.Um,they are very You know,they're very nice.Oh,good,it sounds like you handled it very well,and we thank you for calling in today.But I would like to say one more thing,it's not just a matter of parental rights when it comes to this test.It's a matter of the whole deception of telling people that they're teaching reading and testing for it when the tests do not test reading skills.Let's go to another call.

**spk_1:** [22:02.56 - 22:10.08] OK,let's go out to Fort Walton Beach,Florida over WJNF.Speaking of our phonics method,is it desire?

**spk_0:** [22:11.04 - 22:11.73] Oh hello.

**spk_1:** [22:11.88 - 22:13.33] On line two,is that Desiri?

**spk_0:** [22:14.20 - 25:13.14] Say your name for me,Desiree.Desiree.All right,thank you for calling.We were close.We're talking about reading methods.What,what do you have to say about that?Well,uh,I am a transplanted northerner,and,uh,I did live in New York and I graduated from high school in New York.And at the time that I went through school,it was called phonetics and not phonics.All right,I learned to read evidently very well because I Did,uh,of course graduate and at the time I graduated we had Regents every year and then cumulative regents after 4 years to graduate from high school.We also had Regents at the end of 8th grade and we had a standard 4 year,uh,you know,curriculum for high school and I was very amazed that,uh,a little later on down my life I started college and,uh,seeming that I was probably sort of out of touch,OK.In my reading,or at least I thought I was,so I decided to go into one of these reading things in college because I thought,well,maybe I'd better catch up with all these kids that just got out,you know.They tested me.And I was reading at a junior university level,but I was into the course and I already paid my fee,so I hung in there,you know,and all the rest of these people just graduated from high school were reading maybe it's a lot of them in the 7th and 8th grade level.And they had just graduated so maybe a couple of years ago or just last the previous year.And I was amazed because I've been out of school a long,long time.And,uh,as far as I don't have any children and now,you know,in school,but I do have grandchildren and I think personally from what I've heard on this station that it's what they're trying to do is mass produced thinking in the United States with children.In other words,taking a,a test from a state or whatever it may be.And trying to make mass-produced thinking rather than individual thinking.Yes,I think there's a lot to that,but there's another point,and that is when they say a child is reading at,say,the 5th,6th,7th grade levels,what they really mean is,uh,the child has memorized a few 1000 words in a certain sequence of readers that repeat and repeat those words.It does not mean that the child,uh,can be able to pick up the newspaper and read something that doesn't use the same words he's memorized.I mean,the comprehension end of it.Well,in other words,he can't,he reviews,he knows these words,but he can't comprehend.Is that what you're saying?Well,ah,no,I'm saying his,his reading vocabulary is so limited.He's only been taught to memorize a few 1000 words,and if you give him a a word that he hasn't seen before,then he can't read it,whereas the child who has been taught by the phonics method can put together the syllables,and then when he pronounces it out,he knows the word because your,your oral vocabulary is so much larger than your reading vocabulary.Larry,well,I,I,I'm of course being from the old method,you know,I,I feel that's the best way because I know that it just proves a point when I could go,you know,on to college as an adult.Well,I'm glad you had the phonetics,and I thank you for calling in.

**spk_1:** [25:13.40 - 25:18.16] And let's go back out to St.Louis.Here's Jim over KSIV,our flagship station.

**spk_0:** [25:18.29 - 25:19.10] Hello,Jim.

**spk_3:** [25:19.36 - 25:51.43] Yes,I have two comments to make.One is that when I graduated from high school,I went up to the local junior high.And started the,uh,liberal arts,uh,program there and,uh,first thing I thought I needed to do was get into remedial reading because I'd always been a bad reader.So I got into the lowest reading class and within a week I was up to the highest reading class and it's not because I'm a good reader,but because the reading level in general is so low that I was higher than the average,uh,incoming freshman and So,and that was back in 1974 1975.Well,

**spk_0:** [25:51.51 - 25:55.49] I'm glad you went into the course in the remedial class,did they give you phonics?They probably did,

**spk_3:** [25:57.84 - 26:01.67] there was no phonics in the remedial course that I was only in there for one day.

**spk_0:** [26:01.87 - 26:11.90] Well,very,uh,often the schools will give some phonics in the remedial class.Uh,I believe they ought to start giving it to them in the first grade so the child never has to go into remedial reading.

**spk_3:** [26:12.45 - 27:07.39] Uh,the second comment I wanted is that,uh,I ended up teaching for a while and I,um,Started taking some graduate education courses at,uh,Missouri University and in a couple of the courses,or in most of the courses,uh,they stressed in no uncertain terms that education is a moral,um,process,and there's no way,and this is,this is what they stress in the psychology of teaching,there's no way to teach,um.To children without teaching morals one way or another.You're,no matter if you don't,if you don't teach about God,you're teaching her that God is not significant.So the point I want to make about this particular test is that it,it's no wonder this had to evolve to this.Years ago we taught the Christian principles of religion and so forth.Now we're getting to teach secular humanistic.We cannot,we cannot be neutral.It's going to happen one way or the other.

**spk_0:** [27:07.59 - 27:42.01] Well,I do think that schools are teaching values one way or another,just by virtue of being in the classroom.Uh,but the important factor for the public schools to address is teaching children to read so that they will be able to enjoy the great works of literature,biography,science,government that we have,and the high illiteracy rate in our nation is very tragic,and what we're discussing today is that the,the school system is not doing anything.About it.Instead they're covering their traces by putting in tests that do not teach reading skills at all.

**spk_1:** [27:42.37 - 28:06.26] Reading methods and what's happening in your state.Uh,can you help us out on what,uh,your educators are doing?Agree or disagree,we'd like to hear from you.We will return incidentally with more of your telephone calls and the toll-free number from anywhere in the United States.1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.This is P Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_1:** [29:17.71 - 29:40.68] Welcome back to Phyllis-Schlafly Live on the USA Radio Network.Well,at the outset of this program,we spoke about,uh,Phyllis's articles in the Eagle-Forum Education Reporter that stirred up quite a bit of controversy in Michigan regarding some reading tests,and I'll tell you what,we're still stirring up that same controversy.Phyllis,let's just recap what we've been talking about during the first part of our program.

**spk_0:** [29:40.76 - 30:07.20] Well,we were talking about the,uh,Michigan.Reading test that doesn't test reading at all.For example,I've got a couple of questions here,Bruce.Uh,these questions are given to the student before he reads anything,so it has nothing to do with what he read.So they ask the child the question,sensitive people are likely to ignore their families?Yes or no.It has nothing to do with what he read or whether he can read.Or,or here's another one.Only famous people have true success,yes or no.And how

**spk_1:** [30:07.20 - 30:09.34] is that justified by the board of.Education.

**spk_0:** [30:09.72 - 30:52.29] Oh,they call this their new theory.They're talking about the whole language and it's obviously asking the child's opinion instead of asking him what he read.Then they have a story about fat puss,and they ask a number of questions about fat puss,but they don't ask what did fat puss do in the story,which would indicate to the teacher that the child read the story.Instead they ask questions like what did Fat Puss.Think or what was he likely to do or what was his feeling before the story got started,or other things that are just guessing games.You can look at the picture and see the expression of fat push and and and make your own answer.Let's go back to Betty Lewis for a minute,who was the one who brought this to our attention.

**spk_1:** [30:52.41 - 30:59.57] And uh you,you can participate in this too at 1-800-736-3202.Hello,Betty.Are you there,Betty?

**spk_0:** [30:59.81 - 33:13.79] Yes.Uh,well,tell us what's the current situation after the state legislators had their hearing and they wouldn't let you speak and the state's,uh,superintendent and state people came and testified,uh,I suppose the tests have gone right ahead.There are thousands of pupils who've been given this test.Yes,but I think you're going to find across the state that parents have been going knocking on the door I want to.See it.My child's not going to take it.There's been some very interesting things happening.In fact,one parent who,who wrote a note and said,I don't want my daughter taking the test,the daughter didn't take the topic familiarity,but there was a,um,um,you know,a,a message on her answering service,the parent,and asked to call the superintendent early the next morning,which she did.At no time did she give the school permission to give the daughter the test,but they gave the daughter the other portion of the test that day,and before they gave it to her,they talked with her and told her they realized it really wasn't her fault that she had been put in this embarrassing position.That it really it was her parents who caused all of this pressure to be brought,uh,that's driving a wedge between the child and his parents.Oh,it's terrible.It's terrible.Another,another few things that that I think have happened is,is one parent went in to,to talk about the test.Here were 5 school personnel.With one parent who is attempting to view the past and get their point across.Well,that's very intimidating to the parent,right,right,but I do feel that it has been very effective.Again,I can't thank you enough for the education reporter and the job you did because well,that's what we try to do,tell the,tell the news,tell people what's going on so they can be informed about.Right.Well,Doctor Donovan,the day he testified,he said there seems to be a,a concerted effort.To undermine this test,and I thought there is a concerted effort to inform the public.So without the public being informed,there is no way they can act and intelligently be part of the decision making process of this kind of a fiasco.Well,parents need to know what's going on.Well,well,stand by,Betty.We'll go to another one of our callers and see what they have to say.

**spk_1:** [33:14.13 - 33:17.79] Out to Jacksonville,Florida.Here's Al over at WXTL.

**spk_0:** [33:17.98 - 33:24.05] Hello,Al.Hi Al.Are you there,Al?Well,we lost Al.

**spk_1:** [33:24.21 - 33:28.73] I'll tell you what,let's try for Dorothy out in Florence,South Carolina,W O L S.

**spk_0:** [33:28.93 - 33:31.51] Hello,Florence,are you there?

**spk_1:** [33:32.05 - 33:59.11] Dorothy?Well,we seem to be losing some of our callers here.Uh,let's go back out to,uh,Betty right now.Betty Lewis,Betty Lewis is gone.Ah,Phyllis,getting back to the matter at hand while we try and,uh,regroup with,uh,Betty Lewis,we've been talking about this whole matter of teaching reading in Michigan.What kind of heat did your organization come under with Eagle-Forum in,uh,writing this expose on them?

**spk_0:** [33:59.27 - 35:13.91] Well,we haven't had any heat,and we,uh,hope that many of our listeners will subscribe to the Education Reporter because it does tell you what is going on in the.Schools and uh while uh uh many parents and teachers object to this reading test because it involves values and attitudes,uh,really the principal objection to it is that it's a deception it pretends to assess reading skills when it doesn't do that at all and we all know from the news everywhere that the high illiteracy rate is the is the shocking fact.That's going on now,uh,President Bush had his summit meeting with the governors just a few weeks ago that got a lot of press,and they talked about the problems in the schools and unfortunately they did not address themselves to curriculum.They did not address themselves to whether the children are going to be taught to read and write and to use the language skills that you need to get a job.Uh,really what they came up with was.They want to get the children in school earlier,but that is not the solution to reading.The solution to the illiteracy problems is to teach them phonics in the first grade so that they can decode the language and then they can read all the great books that are written in English.

**spk_1:** [35:13.93 - 35:22.43] And I'll tell you what,if they don't teach it early,it becomes that much more difficult down the line because it's always more difficult to teach someone as they progress along,

**spk_0:** [35:22.49 - 35:30.40] and it becomes so depressing.To the child to be in school hour after hour,year after year,and be lost because you don't know what's going on.

**spk_1:** [35:30.49 - 35:40.65] I've heard your analogy about,you can't break an old golfer of some bad habits,and that's certainly applicable here.Well,Betty Lewis has rejoined us again.Phyllis,are you there,

**spk_0:** [35:40.71 - 37:12.48] Betty?All right.Well,you were telling us about the current situation,and one of the things that I think is so important about this Michigan test.Is that the methods and even the questions themselves are being picked up by the US Department of Education in,uh,what's called the NAEP,that stands for National Assessment of Educational Progress,and,uh,if we don't expose the errors in the Michigan test,uh,these same errors may be true in the tests that children get in the other 49 states.Well,I think it's because of exposure of what's happening here in Michigan that's really contributed to the fact that they are going to have hearings across the nation regarding the development of the nape.They have referred to it as we're entering one of the most emotional and divisive debates in education.Yes,it certainly should be,um.There was,uh,this,uh,Connie Jewell with the University of Texas who commented,she said,I'm concerned about a great number of kids who do poorly on the test,not because they can't reason,but because they can't recognize words.Mrs.Jewell said,We've got to make sure kids can do that before you assess how fast you can run.First assess how well you stand on your own 2 ft.That's the issue.Yes,it,yes,it is.If you can't.Read the words,then you can't move on to their so-called higher order thinking skills.Well,let's go on to another caller.We really appreciate Betty,uh,staying with us today,but let's go to another caller now,Bruce,and it's

**spk_1:** [37:12.48 - 37:14.58] on to Bay City,Michigan.Here's Chris.

**spk_0:** [37:14.84 - 38:47.13] Hello,Chris.Uh,what is your question or comment?Well,my comment as a Bay City,Michigan parent is,um,I'm hoping that more parents find out about this and are willing to look into it.Because not really understanding it,but hearing my children say we have a meat test coming up and those things,you know,I just,I totally trusted that what they were having would be assessing their reading skills and their math skills,and it's important to me to have the teachers know.Where they are in standing so that they can be in the right reading group or math or science group.And so what did you find out when you looked into it?Well,I went firsthand and looked at the tests myself,and I was appalled at the type of story topics they chose and and uh.They teach in in our Bay City school system they have this process education where children are to look at the situation and then they make the decision based on the consequences and in the stories,the children who who stole from a man received no consequences and um so I was appalled at the type of of uh material they were using and then the fact that it,it really didn't in any way measure their reading skills.It was finding out how they felt about this,what did they think about that.And,um,I opted my children out and I wrote a letter to our editor in our newspaper and more parents saw that and more parents looked into it,but.Well,thank you very much,Chris.We appreciate your call and we are out of time and I hope that people around the country will pay attention to what you said.

**spk_1:** [41:01.65 - 41:09.61] On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.It's right back to the telephone calls across America and in Saint Louis over KSIV.Here's Noreen.

**spk_0:** [41:09.78 - 44:33.95] Hello Noreen.What's your question or comment?Well,I have a comment.Um,I was going to tell the listening audience that I don't think phonics is just a good way to teach reading,but it is the only way.I agree with you.Started home schooling my two children 2 years ago this September and I had a 5 1/2 year old which I started,you know,home schooling kindergarten,and a 3.5 year old who insisted that she be included and,um,so I let her kind of listen in the first few days and Phyllis,I was shocked at how she could catch on and how she wanted to learn.And so I just went ahead the second year,which would have been first grade,and ordered all the materials for her along with her sister.Isn't it exciting to teach a 5 year old how to read?Oh,it is a 3.5 year old and a 5-year-old.Well,the first year of kindergarten,all we did was phonics.I didn't even attempt to have them read anything.We just did phonics,and we were supposed to get through the 1st 26 phonograms from the Writing Road to Reading program.Uh,I'm using about 5 or 6 programs along with Alpha Omega materials.And by October we had finished the 1st 26,and I said,Well,kids,it looks like that's it.And they said,No,let's go on to,you know,the blends.They didn't know what to call them,but we did,and,um,they didn't,like I said,they didn't read anything.We just concentrated on phonics and some math,and then first grade they were still timid about reading.They were good on the phonics,and my mother said to them one day,Girls,I know you can read.You have to.Try.Well,this year they're both in 2nd grade.The one is 5 1/2 years old and the other is 7 1/2,and they,we have the McGuffy readers.We have the Victory Drill B.We have,um,Alpha Omega.We have,you know,quite a few different things,but I went to the library to get some of the real old fashioned readers because,you know,they're kids and they'd like the colorful pictures and things.And incidentally,some homeschoolers have told me that the key in going to the library is to get the books that have the older dates that were published 20-25 years ago.Exactly right,and that's what we have.And we also went to a YMCA book fair and got some of the old ones.You know,for a good,that's another thing to do.The,the books that the,uh,schools and other people are discarding,you'll find very useful in teaching your children and very cheap when you can get them at a book fair.But you know,Phyllis,we have a very nice librarian at the Branch Public Library we go to,and I ask her to trace down some of these old readers for us,you know,the ones that we grew up on,not to use them for vocabulary controlled learning,but simply as practice along with the phonics and the other materials,and she looked at me and Kind of smiled and,and she was very sympathetic and she said,you know,they have thrown out almost all of those.She said they were too old fashioned and too sexist in their roles.Yes,I think one of the scandals of this country is the,uh,the way the libraries are putting perfectly good books in the dumpsters and getting rid of books,uh,when they could be so useful.Well,I wish I could be at the dumpster when they do it,but anyhow,I was going to tell you the 5.5 year old now is reading one of these old readers that's printed in 19.60,I believe,and it's the 3rd,the 2nd book of the 3rd grade.So your child is reading way ahead against,uh,way ahead in comparison with her contemporaries in school,and that's due to your teaching her phonics.So congratulations and thank you very much for calling.We appreciate it.Back out

**spk_1:** [44:33.95 - 44:37.66] to Bay City,Michigan,and here's Pam for Phyllis Schlaffly.Hello,

**spk_0:** [44:37.67 - 47:00.81] Pam.What is your question or comment?Well,I want to share my experience about the meat here in Michigan.That's a Michigan Educational assessment,OK.Yes,um,well,I've had my two children excused from that test,one in the 4th grade and one in the 10th.After asking several of the administrators to take this 10th grade meat test,the story section,richer the poorer,the superintendent and a principal said their attorney advised them not to take this test.Now my point was only to allow them to feel how they would feel,to take the test and understand why I wanted my children excused.Then the principal response was,I don't want to be a part of a goal or a thought that it would or could prove to be an invalid test or that my answers would be skewed.Another is that I took a youth.In other words,I would say that that was an admission,uh,that,uh,there are no right answers to the test,but any answer you give would be all right,or it may be debatable what the answer is.Well,that's no kind of a test.How do you,how do you assess skills if there's no right answer?Yes,they cannot accurately measure this,this type of test,I don't think.Did you have another comment?Yes,I have experience in a youth group.I took the 10th graders and I had them write about the story the rich or the poor.I have found that's one of the stories on the Michigan Test.That's correct.What I have found is that not only adults were interpreting this story differently,but the 10th graders were too.There's two ways to interpret this,this,uh,a certain quote Live every day as if it were your last in the story Richer or the Poor.Number 1,don't save for the future,just spend your money.Someone else will take care of you.Or 2,money is not important when you don't have any money.You live and are happy with what God provides us friends,family,love,embraces,and people.This is what is important in life.Well,ah,that story can be interpreted different ways,and,uh,that might be an interesting discussion,but it doesn't do a thing to test whether the child can actually read the words in the story,and that's the problem,and we do thank you for calling.We want to take one more question before the end of Janet Midland,

**spk_0:** [47:03.14 - 48:00.17] Jan,what is your question or comment?Well,I just wanted to make a couple of comments.Uh,uh,first of all,I just want to encourage parents to become more involved with their children's reading.I think there's many factors that help the child to learn.Um,the phonics is very important,and I think parents need to work with their children on that.Um,I wanted to talk a little bit about the,uh,testing.I,I was a first grade teacher last year,and,uh,we.did some testing like the uh the CAT test and the Teams test and it's for,you know,such young children it's very frustrating and I'm glad that if I'm right they put off the Teams testing for the first grade,right?Well,are were you teaching phonics to your first graders?Oh,well,thanks.I'm certainly glad you were.Uh,we're out of time.I'm sorry.I wish we could talk to you longer.I'll be curious to
