**spk_0:** [00:01.86 - 00:11.07] Early childhood education means putting children in formal schooling at age 3 or 4.Many authorities believe that this is very harmful to children.

**spk_1:** [00:13.43 - 00:46.83] Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.We're constantly hearing on TV or reading in the press about some politicians' plans to help children get a head start in life by giving them what's called early childhood education.When children are put in formal schooling at age 3 or 4,are we helping them or harming them?Well,stay tuned.We have some very important authorities.On this subject as guest today on Phyllis-Schlafly Live,I'm Bruce Hayes.We won't be taking your calls today because we've prerecorded this program to suit the convenience of our distinguished guests.

**spk_0:** [00:46.95 - 01:13.44] Our first guest today is a developmental psychologist,former teacher,principal,school superintendent,university professor,college dean,and president,and US Office of Education official.Yes,all those titles belong to the same person,Doctor Raymond Moore.He is internationally known for his pioneer research and writings on the age at which children should enter school,and he's the author of many books on this subject.

**spk_1:** [01:13.56 - 01:19.52] Phyllis,the founder of the Moore Foundation,Doctor Moore is on the line with us now from the state of Washington.Hello,

**spk_0:** [01:19.64 - 01:34.62] Doctor Moore.Good morning.You for joining us today.Good to be with you.We hear so much talk about the need to put children in school and give them a real head start on education,starting them at age 3 or 4.What does your research show on this subject?

**spk_2:** [01:34.68 - 02:03.79] Our research and also the research of Dr.Benjamin Bloom,the founder of Head Start,now clearly says that the best nest for the young child is at home,at least,and we say at least until 8 or 10.And Bill Rohr at Cal Berkeley would say that don't put them into any formal education before 12.Uh,Yuri Braunfenbrenner of Cornell says that you are taking a risk on their socialization,that is on their self-concept,if you put them in school before junior high school.

**spk_0:** [02:04.02 - 02:13.49] Well,the first question I get when I talk about this subject is,don't you want your child to be socialized with his peers and get along with other children?

**spk_2:** [02:14.05 - 02:25.86] Well,the socialization depends on the kind of a socialization you want.If you want a peer dependent,negative,narcissistic socialization,why then put him out with a bunch of children just like you'd put a dog out with a pack?

**spk_0:** [02:26.61 - 02:26.62] Well,

**spk_2:** [02:27.61 - 02:39.39] I don't think if you want a positive,altruistic socialization,then you better make sure that he's with you.Even the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC would tell you that from its studies.

**spk_0:** [02:40.07 - 03:02.03] Well,the general age of school entry in this country,I think,is probably about the age of 6.It's mandatory in a lot of states at the age of 6,some states the age of 7,and we noticed that in the state legislatures across the country,the National Education Association and others are always trying to lower the school age.Ever since

**spk_2:** [03:02.03 - 03:07.49] 1976,the NEA has been trying to get it down to age 3 or 4.

**spk_0:** [03:08.12 - 03:24.87] Well,they're telling us that these,these children are disadvantaged.They come to school at the age of 6 without the necessary skills and therefore we have to put them in some type of preschool in order to enable them to be on a level with those who've come from,say,better homes.

**spk_2:** [03:25.02 - 03:46.96] Phyllis,well,one of 3 things that's happening here.Either these young,these people.are ignorant of the facts or they are consumed with vested interest,wanting more dollars and jobs,or they are lying,one of those three,and I'm willing to defend that before any.Forum in this nation or any nation,

**spk_0:** [03:47.15 - 03:56.14] do they have any empirical evidence to demonstrate that putting children in school earlier will benefit them either right then or later on?

**spk_2:** [03:56.34 - 04:10.02] I'll give them $1000 per study if they provide me five studies that are replicated that demonstrate that.Kindergarten or early schooling is good for a normal child that can have a good home.

**spk_0:** [04:10.41 - 04:21.05] Well,what do you think about kindergarten?Kindergarten is offered in public schools all over the country,and a lot of people think there's something the matter with you if you don't put your children in kindergarten.What does kindergarten

**spk_2:** [04:21.05 - 04:51.34] mean?It means garden for kinder.That's in German,or garden for children.And I,as I said a moment ago,Benjamin Bloom,the lead professor there at the University of Chicago,Who was the father of Head Start and now says that it has failed,says that the home is the best nest for children.The home is the best garden for children,and that remains that way,and I really believe always will remain that way.We should concentrate on parent education instead of institutionalizing little kids before they're ready.

**spk_0:** [04:51.59 - 05:04.45] Well,since you've mentioned Head Start,let me ask you about that.It's kind of a sacred cow in politics.Even President Bush is for putting more money into Head Start.It's got a good name.Um,what do you think about Head Start?

**spk_2:** [05:04.52 - 06:24.49] Well,Head Start,if you take the one single study that has been replicated and has been moving on through the years for about the last 20 years or so from Ypsilanti,Michigan,the high scope study of David Weickhardt and Larry Schweinert,and their highly trained professional and paraprofessional people,notice all these qualifications now.Then they will show that indeed that Head Start run the way they are running it may be productive,but how are they running it?They're not,they don't have typical storefront Head Start or institutional operations.They are going into the homes.Like we suggest and helping mothers become better homemakers,and then that goes not only to the target child but to the other children in the family and even out into the neighborhood.So we think that if you have what used to be called Home Start,and this was operated by Anne O'Keefe,who I think is now with the Navy Department.And but it turned out to be nonproductive politically.But if you have that kind of thing like Ypsilanti's doing,then I would say maybe for children who are disadvantaged,that would be a very,very good idea.But what they're doing is taking.The results of that very highly trained group of people,

**spk_0:** [06:24.57 - 06:26.59] and I assume that was a high cost operation,

**spk_2:** [06:26.81 - 07:00.61] indeed high cost operation and highly trained people in continuity and going into the home,and it's like saying,look,apples are really great,but there's a difference between a good apple and a rotten apple,and I would say that on the side of those youngsters who are really in need that the good apple might be home start as practiced by Ypsilanti.That is not what is going on generally though in Head Start today,and it's a big,big lie.

**spk_0:** [07:00.76 - 07:26.67] But the,and as you say,the Ypsilanti process is not typical of what Head Start is all over the country.Well,let me,let me ask you this,Dr.Moore.We hear a lot about these stress courses that are being put into the schools in kindergarten,1st,and 2nd grades.We are told that these,these youngsters have so much stress and they have to put in special courses to deal with it.What would you say about that?

**spk_2:** [07:27.17 - 07:44.64] Well,if you put a dog in a cage,no matter what nice things you feed the dog,he's going to be stressed,and that's what you're doing with these little kids.I don't care what you feed them,what kind of beautiful courses you give them.You are stressing those youngsters.They don't belong in an institution.

**spk_0:** [07:45.37 - 07:45.73] In other

**spk_2:** [07:45.73 - 07:45.96] words,

**spk_0:** [07:46.17 - 07:54.53] in other words,you think it is putting them in school or a formal institutional setting at too early an age that really is the cause of the stress.

**spk_2:** [07:54.89 - 08:09.57] Not only is the cause of the stress,but it's the cause of our,one of the major causes of our whole societal problem of the breakdown of the family today.You pull the child out before he's ready,and the and the mother is,well,the whole family caves in.

**spk_0:** [08:10.13 - 08:17.40] But would you agree with Dr.David Elkkind that we are burning our children out by putting them in school too early?

**spk_2:** [08:17.50 - 09:00.30] I have two answers for you on that one.Number 1,I absolutely agree with David Elkkind on that and all the others that are saying that.Number 2,I disagree with David Elkkind that we should have daycare.David Elkkind is into the learning situation.As you probably know,but he has not gotten into the socialization aspect,as have Yuri Braunfenbrenner and others like him,including John Wesley Taylor.There are two things involved here.One is stress of learning,and David Elkkind is right on target there.But some of these researchers like Elkinnd do not consider the other factors,and the far more serious factor to me is the socialization factor.The character factor.

**spk_0:** [09:00.38 - 09:07.02] In other words,you think the socialization of children with their peers at this very early age is a negative and not a positive.

**spk_2:** [09:07.10 - 09:31.03] Absolutely,and that was proven in the history of Greece.And as the kids went out with their peers out under the under the slaves in those days,after several generations with the peers or the youngsters getting their values from the peers,there were no values left,and that also accounted for the collapse of Rome and the France of the French Revolution.And it is now causing the collapse of our society.

**spk_0:** [09:31.17 - 09:44.43] I would like to ask you about another question I know you have written about,and that is the different effect on boys and girls when they are put in an institutional setting at the ages of,say,45,and 6.

**spk_2:** [09:44.73 - 10:04.64] There have been many,many sex role studies done,differences between boys and girls,and they conclusively.I mean replicated time after time after time.They conclusively state that the young child,the young boy at school,normal school entrance age of say 5 to 7,lags behind a girl about a year.

**spk_0:** [10:05.15 - 10:05.59] I maturity,

**spk_2:** [10:05.78 - 10:47.82] maturity.Now the child,the boy will catch up in terms of mental ability,maturity by perhaps age 12,but by that time he's a couple of years behind the girl in general emotional maturity.Now the,the result of this.This is one of the most astonishing things of all because every state knows this,but nevertheless,every single state has a law that requires little boys into school as early as little girls,and the result of that is that depending upon the studies that you read,anywhere from 3 to 13 little boys are in learning failure classes for every little girl.And up to 8 boys to every girl in classes for the emotionally impaired.

**spk_0:** [10:48.18 - 11:11.50] I think that's one of the most important things that you have uncovered in your research,because as the mother of both boys and girls,it just isn't normal for little 5 and 6 year old boys to sit quietly at a desk and do neat work with a pencil and paper and be orderly.Uh,boys of that age want to be bumping into each other and throwing balls and all that sort of thing.

**spk_2:** [11:11.98 - 11:32.36] Dr.Robert Strom,the great child psychologist of Arizona State University,would go even further.He would say that teachers just don't realize developmentally what's happening to these boys.They write it down.They,they even,there tends to even be a prejudice among many teachers against these little guys that just simply don't know how to behave.

**spk_0:** [11:32.78 - 11:33.58] And then you have the,

**spk_2:** [11:33.89 - 11:44.72] I just want to add one other thing.Guess what?Here we have a feminist movement going,and these women want better care by men.Is this the way to train men to take care of our women?

**spk_0:** [11:45.17 - 11:58.48] But it's feminist dogma that there really isn't any difference between the genders.That's all your imagination,and that's just due to your stereotyped upbringing.They think that they should be treated exactly the same.That's fundamental feminist dogma.Well,

**spk_2:** [11:58.53 - 12:08.31] that,that would,that would also be the,the what we call the ostrich dogma.If you want to put your head in the sand.Go ahead,but you're not going to see very much.

**spk_0:** [12:08.75 - 12:24.73] Well,indeed they do.And then what,what effect do you think this has on the little boys when the little girls of that age are able to perform the orderly neat work that the teacher seems to expect and they simply can't or won't do it?

**spk_2:** [12:26.00 - 12:53.97] You know,it really is a travesty on thoughtful people.We are deliberately ignoring the truth in order to satisfy ourselves,and I'm not going to blame the public schools necessarily.I'm not even going to blame the feminist movement out there at this point.I'm simply saying that.Parents who are so selfish that they want to have their own private time to the exclusion of their children had better look again if they want the survival of our society.

**spk_0:** [12:54.22 - 13:19.14] Well,I think it's so important that they understand the difference between little girls and little boys at that time.Well,I might say my own experience with 6 children was I thought kindergarten was a total waste.All they got was germs out of kindergarten,and I experimented with kindergarten with my first child,but after that I simply didn't use any kindergarten because I all they had was one.erm every week.

**spk_2:** [13:19.33 - 14:03.64] I want to tell you,I think I think I have also read this in some of your papers,but for the last 15 years or 10 or 15 years we have been publishing the findings of the communicable Disease Control people in Atlanta,the federal program there that finds that the average home daycare child.15 times the likelihood of disease than the other child,and number 2.There,there are about,this comes from the University of North Carolina.Dale Farron was a researcher,about 15 times the amount of negative aggressive acts by children in the average daycare setup as in the average home.Well,

**spk_0:** [14:04.91 - 14:16.47] that shows the importance of keeping children at home until they're able to cope with these diseases.Now you get a lot of those diseases later,but at those early ages,the children have not built up their immune system to deal with them.

**spk_2:** [14:16.67 - 14:28.32] Well,that's,I'm not here to correct you,but I want to say that's partly true.It's even worse than what you're saying because Many of those diseases the child should never get.How about hepatitis?

**spk_0:** [14:28.69 - 14:30.86] Well,that's right.We can all do without hepatitis.

**spk_2:** [14:30.87 - 14:33.65] I had hepatitis.I hope I don't never have hepatitis.

**spk_0:** [14:33.77 - 14:50.05] But it's very,it's very prevalent in the daycare centers.All right,well,this is a very important information that you're giving us,Doctor Moore.If you'll stand by while we have a couple of announcements,we want to talk to you.Moore and also talk to your wife Dorothy Moore who's worked right with you in this important research.

**spk_1:** [14:50.21 - 15:05.15] I was just listening to this conversation and I can remember all the things you were talking about,Phyllis,about little boys being a bit antsy and moving around the classroom.This is P Phyllis-Schlafly Live on the USA Radio Network.Stay with us.

**spk_1:** [17:16.45 - 17:20.69] And welcome back to Phyllis-Schlafly Live on the USA Radio Network.

**spk_0:** [17:21.01 - 17:34.17] We're going right back to Dr.Raymond Moore in Camma,Washington,who was the author of many books on this subject of delaying school entry.Tell us a few names of some of your many books on this subject,Dr.Moore.Well,

**spk_2:** [17:34.29 - 18:06.23] we did one for Reader's Digest,which we now distribute here.It's called Better Late Than Early.Then we followed through with more scholarly books,School Can Wait.Then homegrown kids,homespun schools,homestyle teaching,uh,home-built discipline,homemade health,and the most recent book,which is not just for burnouts,but it's called Home School Burnout.It's for any teacher or any parent that really wants to enjoy children and gives many,many examples of highly successful parents.

**spk_0:** [18:06.43 - 19:04.19] I would say that Dr.Moore is one of the leading authorities on homeschooling.He's testified on behalf of many homeschoolers across the country who The authorities have tried to close down and force their children into the public schools,and we're very grateful for that.Dr.Moore has the,the foundation that he works with in Camus,Washington,and working with him all the time is his wife Dorothy.We also have Dorothy on the line.Are you there,Dorothy?Yes,I'm here.Well,I'd like to ask you,do you have some advice for all these mothers out there?Who think that they need to put children in school in order to give them a head start.I've heard it said that to most mothers,the first day of school is the happiest day of the year.I never agreed with that,but I've heard it said,and a lot of them feel inadequate in in dealing with the necessary training after the child gets to be 4 or 5 years old.

**spk_5:** [19:04.82 - 19:47.51] Well,there's,uh,very little question in the research or anything that,uh,most educators would come up with,uh,that are really thinking is that the parent is definitely the best teacher unless,unless the parent,the mother,is,uh,alcoholic or,uh,abusive or some serious,uh,emotional problem,uh,that she has that makes her inadequate.are impossible for her to take care of her child.Those children need some special care of some kind,but otherwise parent is the best thing a child has.A mother,for example,is,is her and her time,the time that she gives to her children is the greatest gift that she can give them.

**spk_0:** [19:48.05 - 19:52.64] Well,uh,does she have to have a teacher certificate or

**spk_5:** [19:52.64 - 20:15.44] does not.In fact,even our research shows that in the academic achievement of these children.Uh,and many of them,of course,are these young children you're speaking of,but when they finally get to the place where they should be tested and so on,we find that the academic achievement is not influenced by whether or not this parent has a college degree or whether the parent is a high school educated parent.

**spk_0:** [20:15.67 - 20:23.63] Well,if you delay the formal schooling,uh,aren't the children then behind,or do you find that they catch up very rapidly?

**spk_5:** [20:23.73 - 20:46.10] Well,they not only.Catch up,but actually what they're learning is some very basic foundational material that of everyday living.In a sense you have to build a foundation to put those learning hooks on,and the formal learning coming later catches on.They catch on to that so much faster than if they're into it before they're really ready.

**spk_0:** [20:46.26 - 20:49.65] Well,is it easier or harder if a mother has several children?

**spk_5:** [20:51.51 - 21:34.01] Well,I would say that she has to be perhaps a little bit better organized,but it doesn't,you know,you can read to,to 3 or even 5 children,uh,as well as you can to 1,and reading to the children is one of the best,uh,preparations for the child learning to read later on.And when she plays games with them,she can play with all of them.So there are,there are ways of managing and just she doesn't have to have teaching techniques as such.She really just needs to be a good mother,uh,supplying their needs,being responsive to them,talking with them,loving with them,uh,showing a real interest and motherliness in them.

**spk_0:** [21:34.25 - 22:16.77] One of the things that seems to bother a lot of people when we talk about these subjects is.That in discussing it,it all gets mixed up together in the same pot that is early childhood education,daycare,Head Start,kindergarten,lowering the school age.It's all seems to be coming out of the same source.But of course when we're talking about daycare,we're just talking about custodial care.They try to make you think that you need somebody with a college degree in order to give your child the latest developmental experiences.But is it,do you think it's all coming out of the same effort for the government to take over children at an earlier,an earlier age?

**spk_5:** [22:17.13 - 22:46.10] Indeed it is.It sounds like a very lovely plan to help the unfortunate,but it's sort of like if,if some children are sick,you're going to put them all in the hospital,and indeed we We have some some families that are sick.We have some situations that are very serious,and those should be taken care of.But we don't have to put all of the children in the hospital in order to take care of those serious situations.

**spk_0:** [22:46.22 - 23:07.38] I think that's a very good analogy.You would say just because some children are sick and need hospitals,all children don't need to be put in hospitals,and that's right,where some children may need some.Early intervention,I think that's one of the pieces of jargon now or help before they go into school.That does not mean that children from normal homes do.That's right.

**spk_5:** [23:07.74 - 24:00.27] All the research that has been done has been done on,on the and shows that that it is valuable.It has been done with disadvantaged families where the parents are inadequate.But even then,Phyllis,the interesting thing is that the,the Uh,the work with the parents where they've had para paraprofessionals go into the home and take a toy or a book or something where they're helping the parent in terms of her parenting and her mothering.That they find that that is more cost effective and it is more productive for that child and even more productive in the neighborhood.This was proven through the Home Start program and actually is also a part of the Ypsilanti program where they are involving the home a great deal.

**spk_0:** [24:00.41 - 24:07.65] Would you say that a home has to be very bad indeed before it is worse than the putting the child into.

**spk_5:** [24:08.36 - 24:42.02] Yes,it,it isn't just a poor home because some of these things happen in,in wealthy homes.It's the actual condition of the parent and whether or not the parent's problem can be cured.So it isn't a matter of,of training the parent because that is possible if the parent is trainable and if the,if the emotional or the,let's say an alcoholic parent,if that cannot be cured.Then of course some some institution or some person has to take over and help that family.

**spk_0:** [24:42.32 - 25:19.53] I want to go back to Dr.Moore and ask him about that aspect of of education which involves a one on one interchange between the teacher and the child or the mother and the child.If a child is in a class of 25 children.And the teacher has all sorts of things to deal with.There are very few minutes of the day that the teacher interacts with the child.And what do you think about that aspect as compared with the many times that a parent would deal with a child in the home?Are you there,Dr.Moore?

**spk_2:** [25:19.65 - 25:49.29] Oh,you're talking to me.Oh,you're getting to Dorothy there.Anyway.Oh,I'm telling you that there's not even any comparison studies,whether you look at the Jean Glass study of the University of Colorado,whether you look at.any of the studies that are done on school youngsters show you that in the whole mass of considerations of factors here that the child who has 1 to 1 with a parent or teacher is enormously advantaged,

**spk_0:** [25:49.79 - 25:57.21] even if it's not about anything very important,let's say the parent is loading the dishwasher or whatever.

**spk_2:** [25:57.39 - 26:29.29] Of course,as a matter of fact.The very best teaching is done by example.Uh,we're having a little occasion right now out in our,uh,yard here where we're putting,uh,Bark dust around the around the bushes to keep the weeds from growing and so we went out there and we started growing.Pretty soon the little boys are out there and they're learning how to rake it down.Three boys ages 9.6 and 2.And they're doing a wonderful job while I'm in here talking with you.

**spk_0:** [26:29.95 - 27:10.76] Yes,I noticed a couple of weeks ago in Newsweek magazine,they really opened the door on public controversy on this matter of early schooling in a way that I haven't seen in the general media,and they said that that a lot of people are starting to believe that the idea of putting small children in front of workbooks and asking them to sit at desks all day.Uh,which is the routine demanded in most schools by teachers is really not good for them.Are you encouraged by developments like this,or do you think the system is so structured and,and,uh,uh,that we just can't deal with it?

**spk_2:** [27:11.46 - 27:35.98] You,you have someone like the NEA,and I used to be an in-house consultant on that staff in Washington DC.When you have one that's so bound up in in jobs and dollars as that outfit is.Vis a vis the welfare of the child,you're going to have some very,very hard things to deal with.I'm,I'm still,we are making progress,folks.We are making progress,but I'm,

**spk_0:** [27:36.06 - 27:41.02] well,I think,I think the homeschooling movement is the fastest growing movement in the country today.Do you?

**spk_2:** [27:41.14 - 28:04.60] It is,it is.And,and not only that,by the way,you made a good point some time ago,and we have used that when you pointed out that.Ah,from the Fortune magazine a year or so ago,proved that mothers are better off and families are better off financially today with one wage earner than they were 30 years ago.

**spk_0:** [28:05.56 - 28:25.36] But a lot of,but a lot of their social goals have changed and that's a,that's a big part of the problem.So we do have to encourage parents to understand the importance of staying with their children and keeping them at home to an earlier age.I think you have a saying that the earlier you institutionalize your children.The sooner they'll institutionalize you.

**spk_2:** [28:25.45 - 28:29.03] That's exactly what happened in Greece and Rome and is happening here today.

**spk_0:** [28:29.20 - 28:42.90] I want to thank you,Dr.Ray and Dorothy Moore,for joining us on this program.We're very proud that your one of your major articles is in our book called Who Will Rock the Cradle,and we encourage you in your work,

**spk_1:** [28:42.92 - 28:58.61] and we would definitely recommend Who Will Rock the Cradle,right,Phyllis,for this whole subject.of early childhood education,you were talking about how sometimes things get confused in that whole stage and certainly this book would help sort out through the whole vast configuration,right?

**spk_0:** [28:58.66 - 29:03.66] The question is whether the family or the government will control the children of the future.

**spk_1:** [29:03.68 - 29:12.28] And that book certainly does address that very question.Stay with us on the USA Radio Network.We will return.This is P Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_6:** [29:17.17 - 29:19.61] From the east to the west we're standing.

**spk_7:** [29:46.07 - 30:01.95] it's made Like a eagle soaring high above the cloud.So.

**spk_1:** [30:27.34 - 30:40.38] Welcome back to Phyllis-Schlafly Live on the USA Radio Network,and this week we're talking about early childhood education,and I really enjoyed your interview with Dr.Ray Moore and his wife Dorothy.

**spk_0:** [30:40.58 - 30:43.54] He's quite,he's,they are quite authorities on this subject and

**spk_1:** [30:43.54 - 31:05.71] founder of the Moore Foundation,so helpful in this whole subject.And by the way,Phyllis,I'm Glad to know that you'll be including some of his pertinent information in your information packet on this subject of early childhood education,and all our listeners have to do if they want a packet is send us $10.He go forum.Alton,Illinois 6002.Your next guests are on the line.

**spk_0:** [31:06.05 - 31:32.99] On the line from Little Rock,Arkansas is Marilyn Simmons.Marilyn,are you there?I am.Well,Marilyn is one of the very effective volunteers at state capitals in this country who have tangled with the efforts of the NEA,the National Education Association,and others to pass a bill making kindergarten mandatory,and I want you to tell us a little bit about how that happens in the legislature,Marilyn.OK,

**spk_8:** [31:33.06 - 32:44.04] in Arkansas,our law has been in the past that children were not required to start school till 7.And what our governor did was to come with a bill to lower the mandatory age to 5 with a possibility of parents doing a waiver at 5 years old and having to put them in at 6.And what we did was to work with our legislators and point out to them that this was the foot in the door to lower it to 4 and then to 3.And we were very successful for a long time in stopping this.In 1987,we lost it in committee,but we were able to beat it on the floor by talking to each legislator individually,by going back down there every day and asking them if they were still going to vote with us.And we would have our people out in the state call and register their opinion on that and keep the pressure on them all through the session.You have to do that because sometimes they get pressure from other sources and they'll change a vote if you don't stay down there with them and keep on asking them about it.

**spk_0:** [32:44.53 - 33:01.11] I think this shows that the NEA and similar forces are coming in,and they are coming into all the state legislatures,reducing the mandatory school age,making mandatory kindergarten,and every way,I think just to create.more jobs for themselves.

**spk_8:** [33:01.43 - 33:14.33] Well,and Phyllis,what they use too is that they want to get these poor underprivileged children in school and that the parents don't put them in if they don't make it mandatory,which is absolutely not the truth.

**spk_0:** [33:14.85 - 34:18.26] Well,again,we get back to the title of our book on child care.Who will rock the cradle?The one who rocks the cradle will rule the world.And is it going to be the government or the family?That's right.Well,we wish you success in all of your battles,and if there's anybody who wants to take on this battle in other states,I hope you'll contact us because we feel it is very important to defeat bills.Reduce the mandatory school age and mandatory kindergarten.So thanks,Marilyn for joining us.Thank you.We're going to move along to our next guest.Uh,we have Brenda Hunter from Virginia on the line.Are you there,Brenda?Yes,Brenda is the author of several books and she is currently about to get her PhD,if she hasn't already,from Georgetown University.Uh,one of the things that she has done in this connection is to do enormous research on the literature and what's available about daycare.So give us,uh,just a little bird's eye view of your research on this subject,Brenda,will you?

**spk_8:** [34:19.10 - 34:45.54] Well,I,I haven't actually done my own research on daycare,I,but I've reviewed the research that there's considerable evidence out there,particularly,um,since 1980,that when children of,uh,under 12 months of age are,are put in daycare for 20 or more hours a week.About 50% of these children are insecurely attached to both parents,either mother or father or both.

**spk_0:** [34:45.65 - 34:49.10] And would you explain what insecurely attached means?

**spk_8:** [34:49.22 - 35:56.74] OK,um,if a child is insecurely attached,according to British psychiatrist John Bowley,then that's,that child,um,has learned that his mother,particularly his mother,has not been emotionally available,consistent or responsive.In meeting his needs during the 1st 12 months of life.And the reason this is such an important concept is that there have been follow-up studies done of children in preschool,uh,all the way up through 3rd grade,which indicate that children who are insecurely attached tend to be withdrawn,passive,uncooperative with teachers.Uh,sometimes they are verbally abusive with their peers,or aggressive.In other words,an insecurely attached child is not really prepared to learn well in a school setting.And theorists,um,you know,a number of,uh,experts believe that this will be carried over into a marriage many years later,uh,into parenting.This insecure attachment seems to be passed on.

**spk_0:** [35:57.80 - 36:08.74] And does this research show that the when the child is entered into school,uh,he will be inadequate in several respects,not only emotionally,but academically.

**spk_8:** [36:09.81 - 36:45.54] Um Well,there is some argument about that,and I think you,you have to realize that social development is in a sense parallel to intellectual development.There's a tremendous,uh,relationship between the two,but,you know,we have had in history geniuses who were emotional midgets.So children can learn,but it's the,the belief is that the best foundation for learning in any child is a strong,secure attachment to both mother and father in the early years.

**spk_0:** [36:46.05 - 36:59.56] One of the big names in this whole area is Jay Belsky.He appears on television frequently,and uh he has changed his views about daycares on the basis of his more recent research,hasn't he?

**spk_8:** [37:01.04 - 37:47.50] Um,I wouldn't say from my,in fact,Belsky.graded my doctoral exam,so I read some,uh,some,uh,writing of his recently.I wouldn't say that Belsky has dramatically changed his point of view.I think though he has tempered,uh,his argument,and psychologists,and I am becoming one,are very careful about cause and effect.They,they really worry a lot about that.And so they're,they're sometimes very equivocal in what they say,but Belsky has himself done pristine research.Which shows that um that boys were insecurely attached to their fathers as a result of early entry into daycare and,you know,because the mothers were working.

**spk_0:** [37:48.00 - 38:31.20] Well,we have,uh,we see another man talking a great deal on this subject on television these days,Barry Brazelton,and uh I think it's very curious the way he expresses his views.He will say that mother care is the best,but then he'll move right along to say that daycare is a fact and therefore we have to have it and it has to be good and we want lots of federal money.So I think they're really uh talking out of both sides of their mouths,don't you?Well,you have found in your research that daycare is a probable negative,to put it like the psychologist might put it.You're not going to say it ruins every child,but you're going to say it is a risk factor for children,right?

**spk_8:** [38:31.39 - 38:34.40] Absolutely.I believe that very strongly.

**spk_0:** [38:34.49 - 39:08.84] The thing that we were discussing earlier in the program is how in the public mind and even a lot of this discussion,daycare,early childhood education,mandatory kindergarten all runs in together and a lot of the public who do not have children maybe at the present time,don't understand that when we're talking about daycare,we are not talking about education,we're talking about a kind of a custodial care and uh.Do you think there's a big difference in the child under age 3 and over age 3?

**spk_8:** [39:10.75 - 39:13.68] You know,I think children are entitled to a childhood.

**spk_0:** [39:14.08 - 39:14.84] Oh,good point.

**spk_8:** [39:15.00 - 39:40.48] And you,you know,this,this sort of imaginary Maginot line that experts tend to draw before 3 and after 3,I think is,is,is rather ridiculous actually,because,you know,there's a lot going on in a child during childhood,and I,I am personally strongly opposed to early regimentation of children.In a kind of formal classroom setting.Well,

**spk_0:** [39:40.56 - 39:53.38] that's what happens when you go into school at age 5 and 6,and it's hard to see how that could benefit the child to reduce that age to 3 and 4,which a lot of people are trying to do today.

**spk_8:** [39:53.64 - 40:13.27] That's right.And I think the thing that we've completely lost sight of in this country,you know,studies of gifted children,for example,show that the parents are the first teachers.And the thing that we've lost sight of is that the mother at home,the mother who elects to stay home with her child,I teaching that child from the moment of birth

**spk_0:** [40:13.63 - 40:21.87] every day,every day.I wish we could talk more,Brenda,but we're out of time and we do thank you,Brenda Hunter,for joining us on Radio Live.

**spk_1:** [40:22.11 - 40:30.97] And you're hearing one of America's foremost authorities on education today on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_3:** [40:37.41 - 41:39.20] There is no child care crisis in America today.The traditional family is not obsolete.It's not inevitable that mothers will continue their exodus out of the home and into the labor force.Those are just a few of the myths demolished by the new book Who Will Rock the Cradle.Its solid,honest research and analysis from 18 nationally recognized experts.Who will rock the cradle now available from Eagle-Forum?It's an excellent resource and a valuable addition to your own personal library.Use it to persuade your elected officials that mother care is important and that government day care is no substitute.Who will rock the cradle challenges young parents to understand that the most precious gift they can give their children is mother care.Get your copy today.Send 1495 to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Who Will Rock the Cradle?Available from Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_9:** [41:39.70 - 42:38.66] Too many children have been cheated out of the education they deserve.Did you know that nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science?That's a problem we can no longer afford to ignore.Educational excellence in the public school starts with respect for the rights of students,parents,and taxpayers.But what are they?Every student has the right to be taught to read the English language in the first grade.Every student has the right to family privacy,the right to his religious faith and beliefs,the right to share information with his parents.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy from Eagle-Forum.Learn more about the rights you and your children should expect.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy by writing Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [42:40.13 - 42:45.65] Early childhood education,that's the matter at hand this week on Philly Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [42:46.05 - 43:35.72] We're back and we've been talking to a lot of authorities on early childhood education and child care.We have with us at the present time Wendy Dreskin,who's on the line with us from San Francisco.Are you there,Wendy?Wendy and her husband William founded and directed a preschool in the San Francisco area,and I've seen them a number of times on national television.They were operating a daycare center which kind of flows into this area of early childhood education because it was a really first class daycare and they thought they were really going to enhance children's development.Wendy and her husband were highly educated and credentialed,and so were all their teachers,and they had all the latest equipment.And I'd like Wendy to tell our listeners what happened.Well,

**spk_8:** [43:35.82 - 44:17.84] thanks for having me on the show,Phyllis.What,what happened,we started as a preschool,which was just a morning program,and that program was very successful.But as more and more mothers were going back to work,we extended our program to include before and after preschool care,which meant we were open from 7 in the morning until 6 in the evening.And over the two years that we did that program,we saw that the long day was very stressful on the children and that even though we loved them and we cared about them and we really wanted the program to work for them,we found we really couldn't replace their parents,and the signs of stress showed in many ways.

**spk_0:** [44:19.10 - 44:29.10] Well,you had teachers in your establishment who were well trained and had all the proper credentials and could do all the best things for these children,didn't you?

**spk_8:** [44:29.34 - 45:40.21] That's right.We were doing everything right according to what was known about early childhood education.We had staff that was far more highly trained.Than the usual in California,you just need a few courses in early childhood education.Uh,these were credentialed teachers who had,who had a 4,four-year college plus a year of teacher training.We had good educational equipment.We had a very nice facility in a public school that had been closed due to dropping enrollment.And with all that,we still found that the children missed their parents,that the day was too long for them.Some of them showed the stress by becoming aggressive.They had never children who in the morning program when they came 2 or 3 mornings a week had never hit another child,suddenly were biting,scratching,kicking other children.Uh,some other children became withdrawn.They would no longer sing in the music time or participate in activities.They just sit quietly in a corner.Uh,the stress showed in different ways,but it was clear to us that,that it was not the quality of the care that was the problem,but the fact that the Could not be quality care because what they needed was their own parents.In other

**spk_0:** [45:40.21 - 46:15.07] words,quality doesn't mean how many degrees you have or how much training you have.I think this is a very important point because in the current controversy about daycare legislation and the federal legislation.They're telling us that one of the problems is the low pay of daycare workers and that they're not properly credentialed and they want to upgrade it,but you had a fully upgraded daycare center,and I suppose to the 2 year old it really doesn't matter whether the caretaker has a college education.The 2 year old wants somebody's full-time loving attention.That that's,

**spk_8:** [46:15.19 - 46:36.57] that's right.We did have all the,all the degrees and all the training and What we found is that the children still miss their parents,and you can't,you can't buy any toys that are going to make up,make up to them that the fact that they're away from their parents and the,the idea of,of affordable care is,is impossible.

**spk_0:** [46:36.96 - 46:38.85] Explain why that's impossible.Well,

**spk_8:** [46:39.13 - 47:35.63] because if you,if you did raise the,raise the standards to the standards that That they're talking about.Suppose we just raise the standards to the median salary for preschool and kindergarten teachers,about $8 an hour,and suppose we implemented the ratios that HEW and many,many child development experts recommend,which would be 3 to 3 to 1 for the infants and 4 to 1 for the 2 year olds.Uh,if you,if you did that,and you gave in order to reduce your staff turnover,you gave a standard benefits package,you gave sick leave and so on to your workers,well,it,that would,that would mean that the cost for infant care would be $17,000 to $18,000 per year per child.Now,nobody's going to afford that.The,the government can't afford it,the employers can't afford it,and the parents certainly can't afford it.And for all that money,what would they be getting,you know,they'd be getting something that's second best.

**spk_0:** [47:36.97 - 47:42.90] I guess the bottom line is that no,you can't pay anybody to do what the mother will do for love.

**spk_8:** [47:43.14 - 48:08.70] Well,that's true,and what parents are doing at home is productive.Taking,taking care of a child at home is productive.What would be really costly to our society is children who are raised without a close attachment,because these are the children that are going to have problems with drugs and drop out of school and be attracted by a criminal life.And so the parents who are at home taking care of a child are very much contributing to our society.

**spk_0:** [48:09.12 - 48:18.48] Did you feel in your daycare center that you were offering programs that could be described as education as opposed to simply custodial care?

**spk_8:** [48:18.76 - 48:53.52] Well,that,that was our goal,and in our,in our preschool we were,we did have an educational program,but with,with young children,more is not better,and both our own experience and some other Other studies like uh what uh Provence had a study and uh through Yale University with inner-city kids,a very different population than our children,and,and yet the result was the same.More is not better.A half-day program can be beneficial to children or at least enjoyable,but,but if you extend the hours,they actually get less out of the program.

**spk_0:** [48:54.45 - 49:02.18] And then what did you do when you realized that you were not achieving the goals that you and your husband had set for yourself in conducting this daycare center?

**spk_8:** [49:02.50 - 49:19.91] Well,we did a very difficult thing,which was to put ourselves out of a job.We closed the center because we felt that since our goal was to enhance children's development.And because we cared about children,we felt we could not continue once we realized what we were doing was harmful to the children.

**spk_0:** [49:20.11 - 49:22.75] And you told your story in a book,and what's the name of it,Wendy?

**spk_8:** [49:22.86 - 49:26.59] It's the daycare decision.What's best for you and your child.Well,

**spk_0:** [49:26.67 - 49:38.78] thank you very much for joining us today.We congratulate you on making a,a very sacrificial decision to do what you thought was best.For the children you knew and loved,we appreciate your joining us,

**spk_1:** [49:39.20 - 49:53.78] Phyllis.I guess the bottom line of this whole thing is try to avoid,if at all possible,putting your children into a daycare type setting.But would there ever be a time when you might need to?And if so,real quickly,what would that time be?

**spk_0:** [49:53.96 - 50:15.68] People's situations are different,and for those who'd like To know more about that subject,I urge them to get our book,the definitive book on the subject called Who Will Rock the Cradle.Certainly those mothers who do not have a husband to bring home a paycheck are going to have to take a job themselves,but early childhood education is not good for most children.

**spk_1:** [50:15.85 - 50:17.62] This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_3:** [50:18.22 - 51:19.80] Eagle-Forum has been a leader in America's pro-family movement since 1972,you see.Eagle-Forum stands for traditional family values.One way we support the family is that we push for laws and taxes that encourage mothers to care for their own children and encourage fathers to provide for them.All too often we've felt the liberal agenda of laws and taxes that impose disincentives on the roles of mother and father.Let's face it,a child's place is in the home.We'll continue to work hard for our traditional family values because we believe strongly that preschool children need their parents' loving care,not government care.How about becoming a part of our team?Our team of 80,000 men and women is growing,and you can be a part of a team that stands for pro-family values.Write us today for a membership application.Just send 15.Dollars to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002 informing

**spk_4:** [51:19.80 - 52:18.04] the public about real issues in education today.That's the job of Radioive with Phyllis-Schlafly.But we need your help.Encourage your friends to listen to the program and thank this station for carrying it.Get your friends a cassette copy of this program.Give a subscription of the education reporter to your church or child's teacher,and don't forget about our packets that accompany information discussed on the program each week.Packets are available for $10 each on topics such as AIDS education,sex education,new age education,drug education,Quest,the NEA,and more.Send $5 for cassettes and $10 for packets to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Remember to specify the date of the program and topic when you order.That's $5 for cassettes and $10 for packets to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_0:** [52:20.28 - 53:00.49] Early childhood education is a very misleading expression,of course.All children are being educated by their parents from birth,but if you mean early childhood schooling,that's a negative,whether you're talking about daycare or preschool or mandatory kindergarten or putting children in an institution at an earlier and earlier age.I urge you to look into the disadvantages of doing that.And to buy our packet so that you will be informed on this subject which is so important to the future of your children,please join us next week for another exciting program on what's going on in education.
