**spk_0:** [00:01.15 - 00:11.29] What do you think about drug education in the schools and in particular about a curriculum called Quest?It's caused a lot of controversy and has many parents upset.

**spk_1:** [00:14.19 - 00:54.96] Today,the drug problem in the public schools isn't getting any better.Just yesterday,a report said that drug users are mixing crack and heroin together for the ultimate eye.Drugs in the public schools.Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.I'm Bruce Hayes,and we'll be looking for your thoughts and questions a bit later in the program.So you're invited to call in at 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-30.202,uh,Phyllis,how could drug education be controversial?I assume you're talking about illegal drugs such as marijuana,cocaine,and crack.Uh,Isn't everyone for teaching students just to say no to drugs?

**spk_0:** [00:55.28 - 01:18.12] You'd be surprised,Bruce.A lot of these classes just have children discuss,uh,without telling them that drugs are wrong,unhealthy,or illegal.They tell the children to make their own decisions.Our special guest.Today Doctor William Colson is an authority in this field,and we're going to ask him to explain what's going on in drug education in the schools.Uh,Doctor Colson

**spk_1:** [01:18.12 - 01:33.58] is a licensed psychologist who holds a PhD in philosophy from the University of Notre Dame and another's doctor's degree in counseling psychology from the University of California at Berkeley.He's on the line with us today from his home in San Diego,California.Hello,

**spk_0:** [01:33.66 - 01:55.90] Doctor Colson,thank you for joining us.We have just about as many inquiries at our Eagle-Forum Parents Advisory Center about drug education as we do about sex and AIDS education.Uh,will you tell us what you think about what I believe you've called non-directive teaching and how that applies to drug education?

**spk_2:** [01:56.52 - 02:44.29] Most drug education and sex education is cast in the non-directive form,and,and let's limit ourselves pretty much now to drug education.Years ago,Carl Rogers,who was my teacher and then my colleague,got the idea that that the methods that he had developed called non-directive therapy for helping people who were diagnosed as neurotic and who wanted help,these were adults,uh,could be applied successfully in the classroom.And so we put that theory to a test.Earlier at the University of Chicago.Doctor Rogers had been able to show that.A well-trained postdoctoral psychologist or psychiatrist could help people over a long series of interviews to examine their own feelings and come up with their own answers to the problems that trouble them.In the realm of psychopathology,

**spk_0:** [02:44.46 - 02:48.49] but of course those were adults and they were trained counselors.People giving

**spk_2:** [02:48.49 - 02:54.38] the,giving the help were well trained.When we tried it in the classroom,it was a disaster,an absolute disaster.

**spk_0:** [02:54.50 - 02:56.24] Explain why it was a disaster

**spk_2:** [02:56.70 - 03:47.59] because we turned,we turned young people toward themselves for answers to questions that were objective.We assumed that answers to all questions are to be found in the subjective realm.We asked young people to consult their feelings on what they wanted to do.And because one of the prime characteristics of adolescence is to want to belong to the group,they found that they wanted to belong.And they never could be sure that they belonged until they really went against their parents,because they could always be accused of simply doing what mommy and daddy wanted if they made the decision that had been taught at home.And so this youth decision making method,it's called non-directive education in our shop,but more widely known as feeling centered or affective education.It is really quite deadly to the health of young people,and the research indicates that.

**spk_0:** [03:47.73 - 03:55.25] Well,it really doesn't matter how the child feels about crack or cocaine.It,it is objectively wrong,bad,and unhealthy,isn't it?

**spk_2:** [03:55.41 - 04:51.22] Oh,absolutely.There's just no question about that.I heard a talk recently by the attorney General of the state of California where he told a group of drug education,ah,people and,uh,law enforcement people that we really have no choice.We have to stop the inflow of drugs.To this country across the border here between San Diego and Mexico,and he got a standing ovation.And what that made me realize is that when we're at war,as we are over the question of drugs and,and,ah,teenage sexuality,we really have no choice.We have to do what's right.Well,we underestimate our children to think that they have to have the right to make their own decisions.Not only do we underestimate them,we kill them.Literally there are children dying from a form of drug education that says you have the right,in fact,the obligation to choose when what what they're being instructed to choose about cannot be chosen,not in nature.And not in morality.

**spk_0:** [04:51.91 - 04:56.83] We've already made the choice that marijuana and cocaine are wrong,you see.

**spk_2:** [04:56.91 - 05:09.27] But,but,and in fact that would be the way to teach it.It would be we ought to be teaching them the health consequences of even experimenting with drugs,even what used to be called the soft drugs.Now we know that they're just as addictive.

**spk_0:** [05:09.47 - 05:18.19] Have you,ah,in a Investigated this course called Quest that we get so many questions about.Is that typical of the non-directive education?

**spk_2:** [05:18.35 - 06:06.25] It is,it is typical indeed.There are 3 different quest programs.Skills for Living is a high school program that started back in 1978 and it was written by one of the co-authors of the Values clarification manual.And then out of that program there developed a program for junior high school students called Skills for Adolescents.That one happens to be co-sponsored.By the nation's 2nd largest tobacco company,and now there's a brand new one called Skills for Growing which is going into elementary schools across the country.The people who put this program on these various programs on,are not scientific,and one indication of that is that they're already claiming that Skills for Growing is a success,and it hasn't even been completely written yet.They're calling it a highly Successful program.

**spk_0:** [06:06.37 - 06:09.81] Did you say the Tobacco Institute is the chief donor to Quest?

**spk_2:** [06:10.01 - 06:34.13] The,the,the RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company,the Tobacco Institute has its own program called Helping Youth Decide.It is a program of parent training to try to get parents to back off and not give their children effective instruction,but rather to help them get in touch with their feelings.Well,Quest does that,uh,in its own way,and RJ Reynolds is the co-sponsor of that program called Skills for Adolescents.

**spk_0:** [06:34.20 - 06:42.96] Explain how the tobacco industry profits from,ah,telling the children they can make their own decisions about tobacco without giving them any uh guidance.

**spk_2:** [06:43.52 - 07:57.65] There is a certain class of children,a very large class of children who we call invulnerables because of the way that they have been brought up in terms of absolutes.They are often churchgoing youngsters,but they don't have to be churchgoing youngsters,but they are the children of parents who know very well the difference between right and wrong and are not at all.Intimidated from teaching it,these children know that there are certain things which they must never do,never say yes to the offer of drugs.Ah,always refrain,ah,from going out on dates,ah,in,in single couples,um,save yourself from marriage.All those ideas that are now called old fashioned,these children get them,ah,from their parents and from their church.They get them in a very definite form,and the tobacco industry can profit if the children learn an alternative form of morality.Which,ah,Joseph Califano,when he was battling with the tobacco industry,recognized as the philosophy of freedom of choice for children.If they can get you to back off and allow your children to make their own choices,then they've got a chance at your children.But if you practice the old-time morality of giving direction to your children,then the tobacco industry doesn't have,have a chance with them.Well,

**spk_0:** [07:57.73 - 08:21.15] don't you find that many of the educators today have this belief that young people have an absolute right to make their own decisions about how they should behave,and that if parents try to impose their values on them or the school tries to impose a certain behavior on them.Ah,then the child will automatically go in the opposite direction and therefore we should be judgment,nonjudgmental about all of these issues.

**spk_2:** [08:21.32 - 09:09.09] That's right.You know,Carl Rogers,uh,my,my teacher and colleague,and Abraham Maslow,another colleague,uh,both changed their minds about this kind of thing.Rogers in 1976,having pushed non-directive education in the 1960s,said this business of,of active listening and iMessages and No lose problem solving.These things that are the key to the quest method,he said they are very,very difficult to do.And what he was saying is be careful with them because they'll backfire on our children.And of course they do backfire on our children,and ah the school influences them to think that they are somehow independent of the laws of nature and that if they decide to do drugs or if they decide to have sex that somehow it suddenly becomes not dangerous.It's a very,very foolish and destructive policy.

**spk_0:** [09:09.21 - 09:16.07] Do you think?This non-directive education that we've been discussing is another term for values clarification.

**spk_2:** [09:16.12 - 10:01.79] Oh yes,absolutely.values clarification is probably the best known word for all of this,as I indicated,the co-author of the 1972 book called Values Clarification.A handbook of practical strategies actually wrote the quest curriculum in 1978,so there's a very direct connection between Quest and the whole school of values clarification.Now,if you call up your local school district,if they've got Quest,they will deny they've been told to deny that it has anything to do with values clarification,but many of the exercises come straight out of that 1972 book,and I don't know how they can deny it.But they do deny it,and they also deny that they have any support from the RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company.It's simply a lie.

**spk_0:** [10:02.29 - 10:11.20] Well,values clarification is simply a system of telling the child that there is no right or wrong answer,that he can make his own decision and that any decision he makes is OK.

**spk_2:** [10:11.37 - 11:09.98] All he has to do is search within his own feelings and come up with the right answer.That's correct.And what all the quest programs do is to try to help children,as the saying goes,get in touch with their feelings.Well,the answers.To the problem of drug abuse,don't lie in their feelings,because if they consult their feelings,they're going to find the feeling of wanting to belong.That's the one that they have to turn away from.But Quest teaches that no feeling is bad in itself.It's only what you do with it.Now Quest,to be fair to them,will say that that drugs shouldn't be used,but they combine the sensible teaching with this idea that the real answers are to be found in your own feelings and in your own experience.So they have a very clumsy graft between saying no to drugs and making your own decisions,and the children will come down on the side of decisions.And the only time that Quest did empirical research on the Effects of their program in the realm of drug use,they found that the kids who went through the program actually started using marijuana when compared to a control group.

**spk_0:** [11:10.18 - 11:15.85] You mean the research on Quest shows that drug education really promotes experimentation with drugs?

**spk_2:** [11:16.06 - 11:37.45] There has not been one other study in 15 years of research on this from,from a variety of sources,including Quest's own research back in the late 70s.That shows anything else but that children who go through these feeling centered non-directive drug education programs are far more prone to experiment with drugs than children who don't go through that kind of education.Well,

**spk_0:** [11:37.50 - 11:46.83] what do you think about the children after they've had this non-directive discussion in the classroom,then they go out on the street and they meet the peddler who has the hard sell.He's not non-directive,is he?

**spk_2:** [11:47.22 - 12:23.81] That's right.They don't have any competition for the hard sell person.I have told,um,people who listen to the radio,for example,I defy you to find me a non-directive advertisement for a product.In fact,the most successful advertising campaign in history is voiced entirely in the imperative voice,the voice of command,the hard sell.That's Marlboro's.Come to where the flavor is.They're telling you what to do.Come to Marlboro country.These are the people who are putting up money to get mom and dad and school teachers to stop giving directions to children,and what they really mean is we'll take care of the directions.

**spk_0:** [12:24.09 - 12:37.60] Do you think a good,uh,a good The piece of advice for parents if they encounter Quest or other drug education programs in the schools is to demand that the schools show their evidence as to its value.

**spk_2:** [12:38.12 - 12:58.56] Absolutely,you know,we would not allow a new therapeutic agent to come into the school nurse's office,say,let's say somebody came up with a pill that made children smarter,or so the claim was.Well,the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association says.That it takes an average of 7 to 10 years to test a new therapeutic agent before it's allowed by the FDA.

**spk_0:** [12:58.83 - 13:03.79] Well,they've had 15 years on Quest,haven't they?They've had about 15 years on Quest.Yeah,

**spk_2:** [13:03.87 - 13:39.26] but they,but the only test that they did,they didn't publish because they found that it didn't suit them.When Quest found that more kids were using marijuana after their program,they stopped doing research.Now the thing that the parents ought to do is to go into the school board or to the principal's meeting.And say,where's the evidence first that this is helpful,and secondly and more importantly,That it isn't harmful if you would not let the school nurse give out a pill claiming to be helpful without any research.Why in the world are you allowing the school teachers,after 3 days of training to act like therapists on the assumption that this is going to help children?Where's the evidence?

**spk_0:** [13:39.58 - 13:46.33] Do you agree that some of this could be called,group therapy in the classroom by unlicensed psychologists?

**spk_2:** [13:46.54 - 14:28.36] That's right.I,I really think that that some Parents who have good legal connections ought one to approach their state legislature about the fact that the school district may be practicing psychological medicine without a license,and 2 ought to look into the possibility of a,of a malpractice suit against any school district that does this.It is clearly recognizable by experts as an attempt to give professional psychotherapy.After only 3 days of training by amateurs.Now these are good-hearted classroom teachers,but they're simply not trained to be psychiatrists or psychologists.It's psychotherapy in the classroom without a license and without any scientific warrant for it.

**spk_0:** [14:28.64 - 14:35.25] Well,that's very valuable information,Doctor Coulson.Will you stand by while we have a couple of announcements and we'll be back to you.And what

**spk_0:** [18:42.35 - 18:45.59] Hello Janice.Do you know about this program called Quest?

**spk_5:** [18:47.32 - 18:47.76] I do,Phyllis

**spk_0:** [18:57.66 - 18:58.24] board voted to discontinues.Why?

**spk_5:** [18:59.28 - 19:48.32] Well,while I was president,I also served on our quest,um,uh,committee,and I read some information that concerned me,and a lot of it kind of echoed what Doctor Coulson was saying.And because of my concern as president of the school board,um,I requested through my state representative Tom Scott,uh,to,um,see if he would,uh,ask for a An investigation into the program,so he,he,uh,did persuade the state Department of Education as well as the state attorney general's office to conduct an investigation to determine whether or not Quest violated some of the Michigan school code,uh,that was pertaining specifically to personality testing and

**spk_0:** [19:48.32 - 19:48.66] did it.

**spk_5:** [19:49.36 - 20:21.46] According to the,uh,two experts or the specialists the states had to investigate Quest,it ruled that the program did not use personality,um,uh,testing,but use personality questionnaires to,uh,stimulate conversation.So the state experts were dealing with semantics as far as I was concerned.On if quests contained tests or questionnaires rather than dealing with the issue of quests presenting materials that teachers may or may not be qualified to interpret or administer,

**spk_0:** [20:21.61 - 20:25.41] so you were not able to say that it was illegal,but you threw it out anyway,right?

**spk_5:** [20:25.73 - 20:58.88] There was just a semantic that the experts that they had called them instead of personality testing,they called them personality questionnaires,and I had several renowned,um,Doctors of psychology that came out,uh,and supported my claim that it was a violation and that they were using psychological techniques and they shouldn't be because the teachers were not properly trained to do so,but,ah,instead of them listening,listening to my experts,they listened to their own.Experts which had absolutely no background in psychology.Well,

**spk_0:** [20:58.98 - 21:06.70] why didn't they just teach the children that the drugs were bad and wrong and unhealthy and illegal and they shouldn't do it?Well,

**spk_5:** [21:06.76 - 21:26.19] I think the common question involved there is whether or not it's a drug education program or not.They say on one hand that it is.When in fact the Skills for Living program that we had in our school district,uh,did not have even one unit on drugs.They didn't even discuss it,but yet it was being,um,you know,uh,

**spk_0:** [21:26.74 - 21:31.48] what was it all about?Feelings and behavior and attitudes and emotions.

**spk_5:** [21:32.47 - 21:36.15] They had to express their feelings.Students did,and,and,um.

**spk_0:** [21:37.64 - 21:40.74] How long was,how long was Quest in your school before you threw it out?

**spk_5:** [21:41.25 - 22:11.21] Uh,a year.But it was under a different name.It was called the World of Work,and as a board member,I was not even aware it was a crush program till I read,um,in my board packet a little,uh,Bit of information saying some teachers were trained at a workshop at Northwood Institute,and I thought,I wonder what that's all about when I inquired here,we had a quest program that our school board had never officially taken action on that was in our school district and wasn't even aware of it.

**spk_0:** [22:11.45 - 22:22.83] Well,we do find that these drug education courses come under a lot of different names like Li and skills and decision making and And maybe character education,all sorts of different names.Absolutely.

**spk_5:** [22:23.40 - 22:46.98] That's how I think a lot of it is brought into the schools.They,they,uh,in our school district,for instance,they call it the world of work.I mean,it's being,uh,the Lions Club came before our school board and requested that we,uh,reconsider and have this program.And it was a drug education program.Well,what does the world of work and drug ed have to do with each other,you know?Well,

**spk_0:** [22:47.11 - 22:53.85] congratulations to you for getting it out,and I hope you would get the Lions to reevaluate its support of this program too.

**spk_5:** [22:54.15 - 23:09.11] I have requested that they do so.There have been a couple of school districts in the,um,Michigan,uh,state of Michigan that have dropped Quest since we dropped ours.And I think that's real encouragement.

**spk_0:** [23:09.35 - 23:42.34] Well,thank you very much,Janice,and congratulations again.Uh,we'll go back to Dr.Coulson now and see if he has some comment on this.Dr.Coulson served as a member of the technical advisory panel on drug education curricula for the US Department of Education,and um.Um,do you have any further advice to parents on dealing with this?Because now we find that there is so much federal money coming down the pipeline,specifically for drug education through the Drug Free Schools and Communities Act,and parents should be on the alert.

**spk_2:** [23:42.95 - 25:10.29] Any programs that are partially or fully funded by federal money fall under the Hatch Act.And ah you should raise that question now.The Quest people know that their program is psychological because one of the defenses that they suggest to teachers and administrators that be made against parental objections is that in fact the program was not developed with federal money so that it doesn't fall under the Hatch Act.So what you have to realize is that the Hatch Act,ah,only protects you in the case of federal money,but since many of these programs other than Quest have it.Then that's a defense or an attack that you can make and should make.You,you have to realize as parents that there are a lot of different names for these things.Deception is the name of the game,and Kirshenbaum,who wrote the original Quest curriculum,said we have to change the name to,uh,uh,to,uh,hook on to whatever trends are popular in education.So I,it wouldn't surprise me if some at some school district or other they called it back to basics,but it's very important,as Mrs.Rinks did,to look into the background of the program.Quest now will acknowledge privately,by the way,that their Skills for Living program is flawed,but they won't pull it off the market.They continue to promote it.The,the,uh,program for the junior high schools is called Lions's Quest,and they're very careful to indicate Lions' connection to the program,but they have no mention of RJ Reynolds,of course.

**spk_0:** [25:10.73 - 25:24.57] Well,do you think that the purpose of these courses is to lead,is really to lead immature.Children to question their present value system and to find one that has not been imposed upon them by their parents or other adults.

**spk_2:** [25:24.81 - 26:21.00] Well,I,I have long felt,Mrs.Schlaffly,that these,all these programs are anti-parental,and it,it's due to the fact that they have their origins in psychotherapy.People who are deeply neurotic and cannot,ah,get help outside of professional therapy or the clinic will come and,uh,one of the things that the therapist steers them to talking about is their feelings about their parents,their upbringing,so that that influence is to be found,uh,questioning upbringing,questioning parental influence is to be found,uh,throughout these programs.Now Quest will address that in the Skills for adolescents program.They'll,they'll say for example,in the teacher's manual.That,ah,parents may object strongly to this process,this process of,uh,feeling,uh,exploration.So,quote,we advise those students who feel that their parents are going to object not to pursue it at home.In other words,don't tell your parents what we're doing.At school because they might object.

**spk_0:** [26:21.38 - 26:34.29] Do you find also that in these drug curricula,very little of the program has to do with drugs?That's true.I read one of them that was K through 12,and they didn't get around to mentioning drugs till about the 5th grade.

**spk_2:** [26:34.89 - 27:01.78] They come in on the basis of the very real concern that parents and society at large have about drug use by children.That's their hook.But in the Quest Skills for adolescents program,for example,the junior high school program,they have 7 units,and only 1 of those units is concerned with drugs.And then they frame that whole discussion of drugs within the framework of decision making,which is really very destructive and counterproductive,and they

**spk_0:** [27:01.78 - 27:07.93] will say,Don't you want your children to be taught how to think?Don't you want your children to be able to make decisions?

**spk_2:** [27:08.39 - 27:33.52] That's right.They will try to make you feel guilty.About not wanting your child to make decisions about what's illegal.As a matter of fact,they don't want your children to decide whether or not to participate.They're going to arrange for them to participate.They don't want your children to,ah,decide whether or not to come to school.They're going to tell your children to come to school,but for some stupid reason,they want your children to decide whether or not to use drugs.

**spk_0:** [27:34.05 - 27:46.69] Well,the other courses that are on,on drugs like there's Project Charlie,there's Here's Looking at You Too.There are others that don't seem to have any name that are worked up locally.They all seem to have the same defects,don't they?

**spk_2:** [27:46.85 - 28:44.62] That's right.There is a program that's available from the American Council for Drug Education that doesn't have these defects,but by and large,The vast majority of the programs that are being offered locally and that are being peddled nationally have the same defect,and it's because of their origins.They all come from the 1970s when two things were going on.One,values clarification was very big with professional educators who had been reared on the philosophy of John Dewey.And secondly,a lot of educators had become persuaded in the late 1960s and early 1970s that drugs weren't so bad in themselves.It all depends on how you use them.And so now they will say,well,the research shows that you can't tell children not to use drugs because in fact they'll go ahead and use them anyway.But that research comes from a time when in fact the message not to use drugs was being given in a very halfhearted way.Because a lot of the people who were delivering the message were actually using drugs at that time.

**spk_0:** [28:44.78 - 28:50.90] Well,thank you very much.We're out of time,Dr.Coulson.We appreciate your joining us today.Dr.Bill Coulson from

**spk_1:** [30:14.14 - 30:33.97] This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live on the USA Radio Network.This week we're talking about drugs in the public schools,and if you'd like our information packet,we do have it available to you.All you have to do is send us $10 and make that payable to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Yes,Bruce,

**spk_0:** [30:34.09 - 30:40.51] let me tell you,and we do specifically have an information packet on Quest,which is the drug ad program.Discussing today.

**spk_1:** [30:40.58 - 30:48.46] And let's jump right back to the telephone calls at 1-800-736-3202.Here's Betty in San Marcos,California.

**spk_0:** [30:48.60 - 30:52.51] Hello,Betty,do you have experience with this drug education program?Yes,

**spk_5:** [30:52.62 - 31:41.12] I'm not familiar with Quest,Phyllis,but I would like to say several things.Uh,the lady that I did speak to,uh,when I did call did tell me a little bit about it,and based on the minimal information she gave me,I'm certainly opposed to it.I'm a retired teacher from Los Angeles,and I would like to make a few comments.I think that parents are totally responsible until their children come of age for their behavior,and teachers are surrogate parents,so it's absolutely behooves teachers to take the role of informing their students the physical dangers of taking drugs.Ah,we've had drugs in our Country now since about the mid-60s.I know it started in about 1966 or 1967 in California,maybe not quite as soon in other states.

**spk_0:** [31:41.52 - 31:43.04] California's always ahead,right?

**spk_5:** [31:43.12 - 32:22.41] Unfortunately,it's,it's a bad reputation to have.Many,um,my son was in high school in the 1960s,and a lot of his friends,not a lot,but some of his friends,uh,ended up having been major drug takers.ended up with mental illness.They ended up with schizophrenia,and they've been on medicine for the last 20 years.Uh,they have not moved on with their lives because of the fact that they have damaged their neurotransmitters.And yet I never see a group of doctors that is educating the students about the physical dangers of taking drugs and what it does to the brain,and I think this is a

**spk_0:** [32:22.74 - 32:28.70] Well,I think you're right.The doctors ought to take a larger role in telling in warning people about drugs,right?

**spk_5:** [32:28.82 - 32:40.27] And I think that teenagers,uh,you know,maybe ought to be forced to go and visit some state hospitals and see the mentally ill patients,naturally,only those who are there as a result of drug taking.

**spk_0:** [32:40.42 - 32:52.80] That would be a good field trip.Unfortunately,on television you will only see the happy use of various,uh,drugs.And you don't see the bad,the bad part and the bad results,right?Well,

**spk_5:** [32:53.04 - 33:07.40] according to the knowledge that I have of some of my son's friends,there's nothing happy about it.It's very,very tragic.And they thought at the time that they were taking drugs that it was just a big joke and a big lark thanks to the likes and the ilk of that horrible person Timothy Leary.

**spk_0:** [33:07.70 - 33:13.72] Yeah,well,thank you very much,Betty,for calling.We appreciate your insight as a teacher in the schools.

**spk_1:** [33:14.11 - 33:16.44] And now we go to Terry in Portland,

**spk_0:** [33:16.65 - 33:22.57] Indiana.Hello,Terry.Do you have some experience with these classroom courses in drug education?

**spk_6:** [33:23.06 - 33:45.18] Yes,I am well acquainted with Quest.I have spent quite a bit of time in studying.Uh,the whole,uh,curriculum itself and in reading,uh,Doctor Coulson's observations,and I'm so thankful you're having a program like this.I believe it's of utmost importance that parents begin to understand the many ways in which Quest pulls students away from parental guidance,

**spk_0:** [33:45.26 - 33:50.78] and I think we get more questions on Quest than almost any other subject at our parents' advisory Center.

**spk_6:** [33:51.26 - 34:15.37] I believe that Quest runs a heavy duty campaign in convincing 12 and 13 year old students.That they must become independent decision makers and of course as Christian parents we understand that our responsibility,uh,in training our child is to respond properly to God and that is of course in obedience.Uh,even as adults we are told in his word that we are not to lean upon our own understanding,and it's,

**spk_0:** [34:15.79 - 34:20.15] well,what do you think is the worst thing,uh,that,that is in the quest curriculum?

**spk_6:** [34:20.67 - 34:52.20] Well,Quest incorporates,uh,many modes in convincing the child that they should become independent decision makers,but I think the,the worst thing Quest does is reduces the child's decisions to a matter of pros and cons and consequences.Um,where you weigh them both and if the,uh,cons outweigh the pros,you aren't to do it.And if vice versa,if there's more pros than cons and you're willing to accept the consequences and be responsible,then for you it's a good decision.

**spk_0:** [34:52.42 - 35:02.86] Well,do they really adequately tell the consequences,as the previous caller was saying,they really don't show how you're going to end up in the mental hospital or absolutely having your life destroyed.

**spk_6:** [35:03.42 - 35:35.17] Well,we know that that most adolescents find themselves invulnerable to consequences.Uh,I have a good friend whose husband had used cocaine and his teeth are now rotting up,but most youth would not consider that something that would happen to them.And of course,the life and death matters.Um,you,we all know that youth feel invulnerable and,um,as though they will never die.And,uh,therefore their decisions are not based on a,a real reality and an understanding of consequences.

**spk_0:** [35:35.34 - 35:42.64] Well,do you think it's better to have the decisions based on what a responsible adult is?Giving them as good advice.In other words,don't do it.

**spk_6:** [35:43.07 - 36:21.02] That's right.We,we are convincing our children they are capable of doing their own thinking and instead of,um,allowing our children the security of depending on adult wisdom,you know,as parents,uh,we are instructed to train our child not to be passive,and they really deserve the security that depending on our wisdom brings to them.Uh,I don't know if Doctor Colson mentioned this,but I know he has a,a firm belief that much of the teen suicide that we see now are teens that feel desperate about the decisions they have to make and feel ill equipped to do.

**spk_0:** [36:21.39 - 36:48.04] Well,there are many areas where we do give,uh,firm advice to,uh,teenagers.We tell them you cannot drive until you're 16.We tell them you,you should,you should not drink alcohol until you're 21 in most states.Why can't they tell them simply,you must not take marijuana,cocaine,or crack?They want to leave that up to this nebulous area of decision making or critical thinking.

**spk_6:** [36:48.46 - 37:43.32] Yes,that's the major flaw of Quest.You won't find anywhere in the curriculum.Them making a firm statement about the fact that drugs are illegal,um,why in the world they feel it's,it's,um,OK to leave it to decision making is beyond me.It,uh,it should be firmly stated this is against civil law and we must obey the law.Um,Mrs.Shaffly,I have some of the exercises in front of me,and one of them is called Do Your Own Think.And they consider such situations as a no smoking rule at school or a neighborhood curfew or detentions to classes,uh,for tardiness to classes or working for an allowance or no legal use of alcohol until age 21,as we know,many states already have that law established,and yet we're telling our children to do their own thing to determine whether they think that is a reasonable law for a society to have.

**spk_0:** [37:44.02 - 37:51.47] Well,the child is not in a position to make that decision.Well,thank you very much,Terry,for calling.We appreciate that.We'll go to the next caller.

**spk_1:** [37:51.59 - 37:55.75] And Shirley's listening in in Fort Wayne,Indiana over WFCV.

**spk_0:** [37:55.99 - 39:41.30] Hello,Shirley.What's your experience with drug education?Well,Phyllis,I do a weekly radio program here on the spiritual deception of the new age movement,and I've done a lot of research on that.And in looking into Quest,one of the things that concerns me is how much,um,these new age techniques and practices are a part of that curriculum.Give us some examples.Well,in the Skills for adolescents program,um,an article,uh,by a Jim Fadiman called Exceptional Abilities tells the students and encourages them to explore psychic abilities.It specifically mentions ESP.And I'll quote here,these are all common occurrences,examples of exceptional abilities we have been told are out of our reach.Wouldn't it be something if we could develop them beyond our present limits?What does that have to do with teaching drug education,or is there some kind of a trance that you go into if you use drugs?Well,that's a good question,and,and I think that's a question many people have had.What does a lot of this have to do with drugs?And there,there are so many examples of this type of thing in the,in the curriculum that it gets beyond the point where you can consider it to just be coincidence.And these are in the quest program,yes,in the Skills for adolescents program,and of course these are the same people now that want to bring this into our elementary.Entry grade quest is a K through 12 curriculum,I believe.Yes,yes,it's going to be.Well,thank you very much,Shirley.Could you stand by?We have a couple of announcements and we'd like to hear a little more about these new age techniques and the drug education courses.Certainly.

**spk_1:** [39:41.64 - 40:05.47] And we'd like to hear from you too,another segment for your telephone.Calls and some lines are open now.If you do try in and it's busy,well,try back again.We're at 1-800-736-3202.1-800-736-3202.We're talking about drugs in the public schools this week,so stay with us.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_1:** [41:15.91 - 42:33.79] If you're serious about understanding education issues,you need to subscribe to the Education Reporter.The Education Reporter helps keep you informed about what public schools are doing throughout the United States.Find out about the alarming new age courses being taught in Alabama public schools.Did you know in a community college in New York State students can now watch pornography for credit?Stay informed on education legislation.The education reporter is a.Monthly publication that's available to you.How about writing to Eagle-Forum for your annual subscription?In fact,the education reporter would make a great gift idea for someone you know in the field of education.Send $25 to Eagle-Forum Education.Eagle is spelled like the American Eagle.Eagle-Forum Education,Alton,Illinois,62002.Alton is spelled A L T O N,Alton,Illinois,62002.This week on Phyllis-Schlafly Live,we're talking about drugs in the public schools,and if you'd like a cassette copy of this program,we ask you to send us $5 and we'll get you out a copy quickly.Send $5 to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.We were talking with.

**spk_0:** [42:33.86 - 43:48.91] Back to Shirley and we have a a board full of calls.Shirley,so how about quickly,uh,giving us a couple more new age techniques that are used in the drug education courses.All right,uh,another one,involves astral projection,which is what in the world is that technique,uh,practice in the new age movement introduced,uh,to the public on a large scale by Shirley MacLaine in her TV special Out on a limb.And the children are told to imagine that they are standing a few feet away from their own body and to look back at themselves.Then they're encouraged to go on and move clear into outer space and view themselves from that perspective.And at the end of this exercise,they're supposed to again share their feelings with each other about all of this.Um,well,this appears to be a good example of what Doctor Bill Coulson said of making drug education subjective instead of objective.It drugs,illegal drugs are objectively wrong.And they shouldn't be,they shouldn't be made a matter of what you think about it or what you feel about it.Yeah.Feelings and experiences here are,are the main priority.Well,thank you very much,uh,Shirley,for calling.We appreciate that.Good luck in your own radio program.Phyllis.

**spk_1:** [43:48.93 - 43:53.65] Here's Doctor Eric Braveman of Princeton,New Jersey calling over WCHR.

**spk_0:** [43:53.89 - 43:58.79] Hello,Eric.What do you have something to add to this conversation.

**spk_7:** [43:59.74 - 44:24.61] I've been working for many years with drug abusers and schizophrenics at a clinic called the Brain Bio Center where we've worked on nutrition prevention,diet,and treating drug abusers.We have noticed,of course,that they do indeed damage their brain.There's a new device called brain mapping,and it shows clearly that,uh,individuals who've used in.Amphetamines,LSD,marijuana are more prone to psychiatric disease,

**spk_0:** [44:24.72 - 44:25.61] even marijuana.

**spk_7:** [44:25.89 - 45:14.03] Oh,no question.In fact,marijuana causes some frontal lobe problems which probably contribute to Alzheimer's disease later in life.In fact,if you want to do a model for senile dementia,just have rats smoke marijuana for a while,and you can have models for dementia.There's no question,including alcohol,the number one drug abuse problem in the United States is still alcohol,and our world up here is particularly dead to the word of God as a message for teaching children how to stay away from drugs.So I now have a different way of approaching this world,and that is.Pre-diagnosis,I feel very strongly that drugs don't only make the schizophrenic,but the children who become drug abusers already have a neurobiological imbalance that we can identify through scientific methods.

**spk_0:** [45:14.31 - 45:16.28] Many of the,many of the courses

**spk_7:** [45:16.28 - 45:39.52] prevent drug abuse.By saying your child has a high predisposition for drug abuse,bring him in,we'll test him.We'll do what's called the brain mapping technique,and we'll begin treatment.It's far more,uh,you know,cost effective to treat the drug abuser medically.Before he becomes a drug abuser and save him before he blows his brain apart basically with drugs.Well,

**spk_0:** [45:39.64 - 45:59.40] thank you,thank you for that suggestion,but we've had many classroom courses that have taught children or tried to teach children to drink alcohol moderately.Now with that type of teaching,a certain number of them will become the addicts,and it's also contrary to the religious views of many people.

**spk_7:** [45:59.76 - 47:20.31] Sin has always been taught in one way or another to go ahead.Yet some people get hooked and others do not.This whole generation has grown up with a message that God is.Is dead or God is out of our life.Why do some become hooked and others do not?If you went to the bulk of Christians in America,some of them have been hooked and some of them have not,but many of them have tried drugs.I feel very strongly that still that neurobiologically there is a certain predisposition in the ones that get hooked.That can be treated and that this generation needs signs of Christ and signs of good deeds before it can believe and I think that this will be one of the signs to a doubting East Coast that thinks that drug abuse can't be defeated in terms of the demand for drugs.I think that what we're going to be able to do is bring children in at 10 and 15 years old.Their parents will bring them in for.Workup they'll come in for a brain mapping and that they'll be pre-treated with either medication or lifestyle or education,but many of them really have such serious depressions,such serious imbalances that they need anticonvulsant drugs,they need antidepressants,and that these children are using drugs not just because they love sin,but they're really medicating a.Well,

**spk_0:** [47:21.30 - 47:40.33] thank you,thank you very much for your insight into this,but I think you would agree that the bottom line is we cannot have courses that actually encourage children to experiment because a certain percentage of them will become addicted.We appreciate your call.We're going to move right along to the next call.We've got time just for one more before the end of the program.Here's Lynn

**spk_1:** [47:40.33 - 47:42.81] over KS Ivy in St.Louis.Hello,

**spk_0:** [47:42.90 - 49:17.11] Lynn.Hi.It seems to me like we have a A lot of schools that aren't going to get rid of a program like Quest,even if you say all the things that are true about Quest that you've mentioned today,um,isn't it true that in many schools they won't allow Uh,children to not participate in the program and that perhaps parental consent,an opt-in kind of policy would be an answer.That's one way to go.There's one,school board in Wisconsin that adopted a policy that required parental consent and it was against any type of privacy invading questionnaire.I think parents might.Also look at the advice put out by the US Department of Education,which said very frankly that it is not wise to engage in a class in a group discussion of personal drug experiences as some of the curricula suggests and the exercises which have students discuss or relate or confess their experiences can be counterproductive.Uh,I would say the advice to the parents is that they should find out what is being taught in drug education.They should find out if the courses,uh,induce experimentation or are anti-parent.They should ask for a policy that says that children can opt out if the course is going to be given anyway and be on guard against the courses that are integrated throughout the course and not given as a separate course.We have a very fine packet on Quest for those who are listening today and a tape of this program if you would like to write for it.

**spk_1:** [49:17.28 - 49:48.27] And here's our address.And we encourage you to do just that,write to us because indeed your note and a gift helps us stay on the air.Now,about the quest packet or a cassette copy of today,the quest packet is $10 a cassette copy of the program,$5 and our address,jot it down,Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.You're listening to Philly Schlafly Live.

**spk_3:** [49:50.78 - 50:51.28] Eagle-Forum has been a leader in America's pro-family movement since 1972,you see.Eagle-Forum stands for traditional family values.One way we support the family is that we push for laws and taxes that encourage mothers to care for their own children and encourage fathers to provide for them.All too often we've felt the liberal agenda of laws and taxes that impose disincentives on the roles of mother and father.Let's face it,a child's place is in the home.We'll continue to work hard for our traditional family values because we believe strongly that preschool children need their parents' loving care,not government care.How about becoming a part of our team?Our team of 80,000 men and women is growing,and you can be a part.Of a team that stands for pro-family values,write us today for a membership application.Just send $15 to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_8:** [50:55.92 - 51:52.06] The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,a place where the most powerful man in the world resides,the president of the United States.But what many Americans don't know is that some of our nation's most important decisions aren't made in the Oval Office.Because according to the Constitution,the power to make laws was granted only to Congress and not to the president.That's why only Congress can declare war,raise and support armies,and approve treaties.The bill is passed.The Constitution,the words we live by.To receive a free copy of this great document and information about it,write Constitution,Washington DC 200063999.A message from the commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution and the Advertising Council.

**spk_0:** [51:53.08 - 52:33.00] Every parent who has a child in school should look into what is being taught in the name of drug education.Is it anti-parent?Does it use psychological techniques such as guided fantasy or relaxation,role playing,or even hypnosis?Does it use.Values clarification and not tell the children what is right and what is wrong when it comes to illegal drugs.Does it use personality tests which are an invasion of privacy?These are things you ought to know before your child is led into experimentation.Next week we're going to talk about AIDS education,which is now being mandated by at least half the states across the country.
