**spk_0:** [00:01.24 - 28:17.66] Has your local public school prohibited the celebration of Christmas this year or even the mention of Christmas?Welcome live via satellites on the USA Radio Network,the program putting you at the forefront of what's really happening in America's public schools.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and I'm Bruce Hayes inviting you to stay with us for the next hour and of course get in while you can because we're going to have an interesting one today,Phyllis.Our telephone.Number from anywhere in the continental United States 1-800-736-3202.Just something to spark your interest.Uh,some questions here.Are your child's school holidays called Christmas holidays,or does the school try to conceal the religious nature and origin of Christmas by calling it a winter holiday?Are the schoolchildren in your community allowed to sing Silent Night in school,or are they allowed to sing only non-religious songs such as,let's say,Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer?Well,give us a call again.We're at 1-800-736-3202.Phyllis,we want to get their experiences.Our guest today on this timely topic of Christmas observances in public schools is Doctor Daniel Dreisbach of the Rutherford Institute in Charlottesville,Virginia.He's a graduate of the University of South Carolina,a Rhodes Scholar with a PhD from Oxford University in England,and has his law degree from the University of Virginia.He's the author of a treatise on religious freedom published by Crossway called Religious Liberty and the First Amendment.And he's also the author of a special paper which I read last night called The Constitutionality of Religious Holiday Observances in Public Schools,and that's the precise topic on which we would like to question him today.Welcome to our program,Dr.Daniel Dreisbach.Are you there?Yes ma'am.Well,thank you so much for joining us.It's my pleasure.It's,I'm happy to join you today.I was so happy to discover that you have some special expertise on this timely topic of Christmas in the public schools.And let's start off by asking you,hasn't the US Supreme Court in several opinions specifically recognized the validity and appropriateness of Christmas observances?Yes,they have.Ah,there is,as you know,a lot of misinformation,ah,out there in the public arena as to the role of religion in public life.But on several occasions,the Supreme Court has,ah,made the point very clearly that the state and the government has a role in accommodating religion and its role in the public life of American citizens,and the court has said that not every involvement of religion.In public life is,is unconstitutional.Well,didn't the court also recognize that hymns and Christmas carols are part of our religious heritage?Absolutely.Ah,a few years ago,ah,the Supreme Court was not addressing the specific issue of holiday observances in public schools,but in passing,ah,the court said when it was noting this type of accommodation,said that.Ah,Christmas hymns and carols in public schools are one of the legitimate forms of taking official note of Christmas and our religious heritage,ah,in this country.Well,are all those cases back in the last century?I know there was one,much quoted case,uh,from around 1880 or 1890 calling us a religious nation.Uh,do you have any,uh,recent,uh,Supreme Court cases that uphold the importance and validity of recognizing religion as part of our,uh,culture?Oh,absolutely.Uh,in fact,uh,this language that I just referred to.Ah,came from a 1984 decision of the Supreme Court,and what was the name of it?The case was Lynch versus Donnelly,and that had to do with the placement of a nativity scene sponsored by a municipality in the public arena.And in that particular instance,the court,ah,affirmed that policy.Well,ah,if,ah,they could place a nativity scene on public property,does that mean it can also be placed in a public school?Well,that is a,that's a tricky question.The Supreme Court hasn't tackled that directly,right?I think that it has to be pointed out that the Supreme Court has not specifically addressed that issue,and In its other decisions,the court has always noted that given the impressionability,ah,let's say,of young people,ah,the question of religion and public education is a particularly sensitive issue.Um,but I think that in other words,you might not be led to have a religious thought if you walk by a public square and see a nativity scene.But my goodness,if the nativity scene is seen by elementary school students,they might be affected.Therefore,the ACLU would say you couldn't have it in the schools,right?That certainly is a position that the ACLU has taken.And the Supreme Court,as I say,has been sensitive to the role of religion in pub in in public schools,but I think there's a very simple way of,of clarifying what the Court has said about religion in public schools.The court has,ah,has made a distinction between the discussion and study about religion in schools,which they say is acceptable.Ah,indeed they say that's a part,an essential part of quality education.On the other hand,they've said that,ah,state sponsored devotional exercises or religious worship in the public schools,that's a different question,and,ah,and they have suggested in a number of opinions that that kind of,of,ah,practice is,is unacceptable.Now you,um,I think,are saying that the court has worked itself around to saying that the schools can teach about religion with the key word being about,ah,but,ah,cannot teach religion.Exactly,and I,I would go further than that and,and say that I think the court acknowledges that there's an affirmative duty on the part of public educators to make children or to,to uh,to encourage children to understand and acknowledge and appreciate the important role religion has played in our heritage,in our development as a coun country.But that again is not to say that the court has endorsed the worship or devotional type exercises in public schools.Now I do have to point out that there are a lot of people who have a problem even with the schools teaching about religion.I think you would find coming from one direction would be the ACLU,who would say that any teaching about religion that attempts to make,say,the Christian religion a preeminent one or that its place in our heritage has been preeminent,they would find that objectionable.Then coming from another direction,you find that sometimes these textbooks which start to teach about religion bring in all sorts.Of practices of some of the the eastern mystic mystical religions,and many people find that very objectionable too.Also there are those who find it objectionable for the school to be putting out the notion that one religion is as good as another.That's very offensive to people who think they belong to the one true religion.Sure,I think you,you've put your finger on the problems that we have in,in public education,and,ah,the,the position that I would like to advance and is certainly a position that the Rutherford Institute has been active in supporting,is,is simply asking for an even playing field.We're saying that,ah,children who come from a religious background,ah,should not,uh,be put in a position in public education where those values are undermined.We're not advocating that,uh,the public schools should be a,an instrument for,for,uh,uh,evangelical,ah,ministries sponsored by the state.We're not,we're not advocating that at all.We're simply looking for a,a fair playing field where religious students can express themselves,express their own personal views on the same basis as students who.Want to express a political point of view or some other ideology.Well,that gets into the area of student initiated self-expression.We've had a number of complaints at our parents' advisory center in Eagle-Forum and I'll bet you have also with the Rutherford Institute about students who wanted to express something religious in speech,in a recitation in Song,music,visual arts,and an overzealous principal or superintendent have denied the students the right to do this,the right to sing a religious song or recite a religious verse in any type of a talent program or or anything in which the student was allowed to select whatever the student wanted to give.And haven't you and the Rutherford Institute tried to help some of those students as a matter of their rights,their First Amendment rights under the Free Exercise Clause?Oh,absolutely,and I would say not just the Free Exercise Clause.I think also the free speech clause of the First Amendment is an important area in defending these particular rights.And,and,and you're correct in noting that we receive a lot of Of requests for assistance with these types of cases just recently,ah,I,I was involved in a case where a,a young,uh,student wanted to participate in a school talent contest,and,uh,the school administrators had advertised through.Throughout the school that anyone could bring their talent and put it on public display,but when the student wanted to sing a song referring to her faith in God,the school said,no,no,you can't do that.And I think this is a proper point to make.A,a,a distinction about the Constitution,and I hope that,ah,ah,your audience will listen to this carefully.The First Amendment is something that applies to the government.It's the government that cannot establish a religion,ah,pursuant to the First Amendment.It,it has no prohibition on the right of a student or a private citizen to express themselves,and this is particularly important,ah,in the area.Of religious holiday observances,it is perfectly acceptable for a student to bring a nativity scene to school as part of a show and tell,which is a very common practice in many public schools,and it certainly should be legitimate for a pupil to,to give a speech in front of the class on her or his or her views about the meaning of Christmas or any religious holiday.I think we've also been onto that case you referred to where the girl tried to sing a religious hymn as part of a talent show when the students could pick any song they wanted and the,the,the school denied the student the right to sing it,but then it turned out that the student's mother is a lawyer and she isn't going to let it drop.So I think we're going to have a story about that in our next issue of the Education Reporter.Uh,tell me,do you think that those who are trying to purge the schools of every mention of religion or Christmas,and indeed there are very pushy organizations that are trying to do exactly that,uh,do you think they base their argument on the assumption that whatever this school does,which is a government school,uh,is endorsing,uh,uh,is,uh,therefore a violation of the First Amendment.And that it can be considered to be endorsing everything that it doesn't actually censor.In other words,if they would say that if the school allows the child to sing a song about Jesus,then therefore the school is endorsing Jesus,and that isn't so at all.That's right.And you're,I think you summarized very well what the argument made by the ACLU and a number of other organizations.Ah,that,that is precisely their argument.Ah,but they,they're sort of,ah,caught in a,in a,a dilemma here because many of these same organizations have lobbied,ah,for the right of a,ah,ah,of a,of a socialist speaker or someone representing some other political or ideological point of view to make their state their case or or give a speech in the public school.And,ah,they have supported that right,and,but when it comes to religious speech,that's oftentimes viewed in a through a different pair of glasses as if that is somehow a more dangerous type of speech and a less protected form of speech by the Constitution,and I think that is a particularly pernicious attitude.Ah,that,ah,has been advanced by,ah,the ACLU and a number of other organizations,and that is,uh,one of the areas that we're very active here at the Rutherford Institute is to try to,to,ah,ensure that religious students and,and religious citizens in this country have the same rights,ah,of free speech,of free association,of free exercise as,as individuals and citizens who want to express some political.Or or secular point of view.I'm glad you pointed out the double standard of those.I think the ACLU and others have,have defended the right of a student to come to school with a bad word on his t-shirt and all sorts of outrageous protests at the same time that they try to deny any type of free expression on religion.We've been talking with Dr.Dreisbach of the Rutherford Institute,and we're going to be Back after the break and take your

Christmas,uh,even the mention of Christmas?Well,of course,we're addressing the issue today,and we invite your telephone calls.Come on in.We want to hear from you at 1-800-736-3202.Again,1-800-736.3202.We're talking with Dr.Daniel Dreisbach of the Rutherford Institute who's quite an authority on this issue of church and state,particularly as it relates to the public schools,and we're interested in this whole subject of Christmas observances and the people who are trying to get it out.Dr.Dreisbach,let me ask you this question.We both referred to this case over in Ohio where the school prohibited the little.from singing a religious song in a talent show and the mother turned out to be a lawyer and she filed a big brief and then the American Civil Liberties Union,which had first aggressively backed the prohibition of the little girl singing the song,is now saying they're going to take a second look,and the local executive director of the ACLU said,quote,Well,if for instance a child in school is singing a song to himself or saying a prayer to himself,that can't be prohibited,close quote.Can you believe that they would say anything so patronizing as that?What are they,these thought,thought control Gestapos that want to monitor everything that everybody thinks in the public schools?Well,I,you're,you're The the view they expressed there unfortunately is not an uncommon view.I mean,I think that there are a lot of people out there who are very zealous in trying to exclude any mention of religion,any mention of God.Ah,from the public arena,we're not talking just about public schools.This is a phenomenon throughout our culture and our society.I mean,I've,I'm aware of suits where,where individuals,ah,very antagonistic to religion have,have tried to,ah,ban billboards,um,that have some kind of religious.So I think that there are people out there who are very hostile to the role of religion in public life wherever that that role should be played out.Well,we've got some calls waiting.Let's see what our listeners want to ask you.And we go to 1-800-736-3202 and we visit with our flagship station.First,here's Susan over at KSIV.Hello Susan,what is your question or comment?Well,um,I was a music teacher,um,working in a school here in St.Louis,um,doing my fieldwork,and the woman who was in charge of the chorus there in the high school,which is,I guess,65% Jewish,told me about how,um,several years ago she had a traditional Christmas program.Um,which had the Christmas music and she included Hanukkah music and ever since,um,that year she has had to go and be paraded before a big council,um,where she is reprimanded for having brought up Christianity and,um,has to,in order to keep her job,um,go through this every year and be reminded of her great crime.And I was just wondering,uh,what kind of comment you or Mr.Dreisbach would have on that situation.Well,let's hear what Dr.Dreisbach has to say on that.Well,I think,uh,unfortunately again,uh,that's not an uncommon situation.I think that,ah,obviously teachers in the public school setting have an obligation to be sensitive to the beliefs of all their pupils.Ah,there are going to be pupils,students who,ah,for,for,for a variety of reasons,um,religious reasons who want to be excused from a,a discussion about the meaning of Christmas or a discussion about the meaning of Hanukkah or any other religious holiday,and I think that there is a constitutional right perhaps to be excused in that kind of setting.I think that this is perhaps a good time to mention.Ah,perhaps the,the,a brief,uh,summary of some guidelines in this area.I think that,ah,when discussing or,or,uh,observing a religious holiday.Ah,in the classroom,the presentation,I think,should be in a prudent and an objective,uh,manner,and,ah,there should be a discussion of,of the cultural and religious heritage of the country and,and of the,ah,religious sources of the holiday and how that has impacted our society and our culture,and I think obviously we've made this point already today.I don't think that religious holidays,ah.Should be or that teachers should use the occasion as a subtle way to proselytize students in the classroom,but that's not what we're talking about.No,most of the time we're just talking about singing the Christmas carols,the same one we hear when we turn on our radio anytime between Thanksgiving and Christmas.Absolutely.I think another point that I would make here is that I think there are a lot of school districts out there who have,ah,have really been the victims of this misinformation that's been generated by,aren't they scared by that letter they got from the lawyers in the ACLU threatening a lawsuit?Absolutely,and that's why it's so important to get the correct information into the hands of of.Public school administrators and let them know what they can and cannot do.Well,we hope that you'll develop a system of sending threatening letters from the Rutherford Institute which will have the effect on the other side.Well,we're certainly active in trying to educate the public.Let me just mention this other point.We're talking about Christmas today,and that's certainly timely given the season,but There are a number of other religious holidays in the public calendar,including Saint Patrick's Day and Saint Valentine's Day and Thanksgiving,and I,I think it's important that,ah,we keep in mind that the principles that we're talking about today in regards to Christmas really apply equally to these other holidays.Well,since you bring that up,ah,ah,let's,ah,apply them equally to Halloween,which causes a lot of problems for people and which we've discussed earlier.Let's go to another.Elsie's listening in New Jersey over WCHR.Is that Elsie?Yes.What is your question or comment?My comment is that my daughter's in kindergarten and she tries to show the children that she loves the Lord and she wanted to take a tape to school so that the children could listen to it and she came home and she was very upset because the teacher said she was not allowed to play it.But she didn't understand because the other children are allowed to bring something in that they are allowed to listen to,and it's really hard because we're teaching her that Christmas is about Jesus being born and us being saved because of Him being born,and all she keeps coming back with is,well,Santa Claus,the teacher says Santa Claus.I is real and Santa Claus will bring you what you want if you're good,and it's really making it hard with us in teaching her about the Lord,but the schools feel that they are fine in teaching her what they want to teach,and I even sent a letter to the school saying that my daughter is not to participate in the Halloween,um,activity.but she still came home with the Halloween activities,and I really think that it's unfair that they refused to let her play a tape.Well,it does show the double standard.I don't think that students should select the curriculum for the school,but I think this gets back to what Dr.Dreisbach said about the level playing field.Would you like to comment on that?Absolutely,and I think this is a good illustration of that.And if,if a classroom,if a teacher,ah,has a,a,a discussion time where students are invited to share some kind of viewpoint or to tell a story or to,ah,be involved in some kind of a tape or sing a song,it's what we used to call when I was in school show and tell time and Ah,I think that if other students are allowed to participate in that,then certainly a,a student,a student initiated,uh,activity of this nature is certainly within the bounds of the Constitution and,uh,and should be permitted.And Darwin's listening in Fort Wayne,Indiana over at WGL.Hello Darwin,what is your question or comment?Hello,hello,are you there?Ah well,we'll push forward,we'll push forward back in St.Louis.Here's Marty over at KSIV.Hello Marty.What is your question or comment?I'd like to know.I've never heard a good explanation nor read a good explanation of how the First Amendment,how the Establishment Clause in there has been turned around to mean separation of church and state.I've never really Hurt hurt any of,you know,the historical background on,I'll bet Dr.Dreisbach could give you an hour's lecture on that,but let's let him make a try at answering in a minute.Yeah,that,that is a very long and complicated,uh,point,um,and I,I think the story behind how the Establishment Clause has been sort of turned on its head is really the story of the secularizing of our culture and some of the.Ah,the dangerous implications of that.But,ah,to make it very short,uh,in the late 19th century and more recently about the middle of this century,the Supreme Court started to refer to Ah,the language of Thomas Jefferson,who described the First Amendment as building a wall of separation between church and state,and the Supreme Court has really substituted the very clear language of the First Amendment,ah,with,ah,Jefferson's language,and,ah,and I think that it's important to know that.Jefferson really didn't have in mind a sort of a separation of religious values from public life,which is how that word,the term separation of church and state,has come to mean today.Rather,Jefferson saw a very institutionalized separation of the offices of of the government and the offices.Of the church,what he had in mind was what,what to avoid what was the experience in Europe where you had an established Church of England or an established Church of Scotland and what that's what Jefferson had in mind.But yet in today's environment these words have taken on new meaning to Ah,which in the hands of a secular minded person is,is a separation of,of,of religious values and,and the value that they,ah,have for society to separate that entirely from the public arena.Well,I mean,at the time of the Constitution,most of the 13 states did have an established church,and I think what the founding fathers were talking about was preventing the federal government from establishing religion.So indeed it has become distorted.Constitutional lawyer P Phyllis-Schlafly and the program is known as Phyllis-Schlafly Live.We need to hear from you.Come on in.We're at 1-800-736-3202.We will return.Stay with us on

Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we're talking about Christmas or lack thereof in the public schools.Of course,we invite your telephone calls 1-800-736-3202.The best time to get through is when you hear somebody.Hang up.We have a fascinating guest,Phyllis,and we're talking with Dr.Daniel Dreisbach of the Rutherford Institute in Virginia.He's quite an authority on this issue.We're going to go right back to our calls,but first of all,Dr.Dreisbach has got a packet on this subject that you can get by writing in.You want to give the information on that?Sure.We have prepared a brief report on Ah,the constitutionality of religious holiday observances,and,uh,you can get that by writing the Rutherford Institute at PO Box 7482 Charlottesville,Virginia.22906 and how much is it?Well,we,we would suggest a donation of about $20 to cover the preparation of it and shipping and handling.It's a very fine paper.I've read it.All right,we're ready for more telephone calls from across America.We visit with Roy in College Station,Texas over KAGC.Hello Roy,what is your question or comment?Yes,hello,I'm here.It seems to me that we might be one of the bright spots in the country because we don't seem to have any problem with.Singing carols in the,uh,school programs.My daughter is a member of the high school choir,and last week they had a,uh,school concert,and they sang,uh.Many of the usual Christmas carols and invited the audience to to join in.You mean like Silent Night,Joy to the world,and so forth?Yes,and nobody has sued you.No,I think they get short shrift.Well,good for you.I congratulate you and that lets our listeners know around the country that that can be done.Well,I just wonder how many.Places that have the freedom that we have down here whether we're just a lone place or whether there's many other schools that actually are doing what we're doing.Well,that's Texas for you.That's right,you bet.And and Roy has a fine Texas accent.I can hear it.Thank you for calling,Roy.Let's take another call.Alts Oklahoma,KKVO.Here's Laurie.Hello Laurie,what is your question or comment?Yes,this has to do with the separation of church and state issue.We are a military family,and I was wondering,is the military chaplaincy in any danger of being abolished?No,I would say it isn't,but let's let Dr.Dreisbach answer that.Well,there have over the years been a number of court challenges to chaplains in the military.as well as chaplains in legislative bodies around the country,but those have all failed.I think there was a rather recent case to do with challenging the chaplain,wasn't it,in the Nebraska legislature?Yes,in 1983,the Supreme Court addressed that issue,and the Supreme Court took a very unusual tact,one that they have rarely taken in recent years,and the Court said that Given that the very Congress which passed the First Amendment back in 1789,ah,also provided funds for,ah,legislative chaplains for the first Congress,it would be absurd to find that an unconstitutional act or a violation of the First Amendment.Well,that's one of the most intelligent remarks I've read in any Supreme Court opinion lately.They might also discover someday that all of the founding fathers attended religious schools.They did not attend secular schools.That's right.And we have another station in Texas,a fine one in Houston,KTEK.And here's Darryl.Hello Darryl,what is your question or comment?Well,my comment is that the secularizing of our society is removing the key ingredient from which makes our American democracy work.Before there was a Statue of Liberty in New England,the New England people set up,I mean in New York,they set up a Statue of Liberty in New England to worship,educate,make laws,and do business according to the Bible,and the key ingredient that makes democracy work is the realization that democracy is a byproduct of Christianity.If we take Christianity out,it's going to fall on its face.And the church was what started the schools in the first place before the federal government took it over.Well,let's let Doctor Dreisbach comment on that.Well,I think he's certainly making a good point.I would like to use that just to make a,uh,I think a related point,and it goes back to the caller,uh,we had a few minutes ago who,uh,mentioned that,ah,her child wasn't allowed to play a tape.Now if we believe that,ah,this is a democratic society,let's think about the message that the public school is sending out if students are told you can't talk about religion in the school.The message that that conveys is that religious speech is.Less valued is less of a of a an important part of our democratic process is less important to the marketplace of ideas,and I think if,if you,ah,put your mind to it,you'll see that that's a very undemocratic position that the public schools are frequently taking.Well,thank you very much for that comment.Let's go to the next call.Interesting conversation if you want to jump in.We're at 1-800-736-3202.Jim in Franklin Park,New Jersey wants to jump in.Phyllis.Hello Jim.What is your question or comment?Yes,I went to Franklin High School and When I was a,uh,a freshman,I,I noticed that,uh,you know,passing earth science was.Impossible from day one.I didn't know why.I was like a scrambled around kid at the time,and they were They were teaching,ah,you know,Darwin's theory,and the teacher came over and it seemed to be looking straight at me,ah.You know,with the,you know,real.Serious look and I just,you know,I started to read it and I,I just put it away,you know,and,uh.I,I,you know,I just never believed it,and I.You know,I was failing and.This and that,but you know,mine was like uh.More like the Ministry of Music because I was music saved me.From,well,in all fairness to the Supreme Court,when they threw prayer and Bible reading out of the schools,I don't think they thought they were doing something antagonistic to religion.I think they were trying to preserve a neutrality,but what happened was that a lot of people went so much farther and they threw out every type of of moral training.And,and,ah,the what we were left with was an aggressive teaching of situation ethics,evolution,and various things that many of us would consider anti-religious.Well,my main point is this that I think they,they need to acknowledge,they need to acknowledge God or respect for God,even if they don't believe in it because they,they acknowledge it when,when the earthquakes or,you know,hurricanes hit and,ah.Well,at least they,at least they should not deny him in the classroom.Let's see what Doctor Dreisbach has to say on this.Well,I,I think you're,you're right in referring back to the school prayer cases,and let me just read one sentence from that case.Ah,the court said any,any attempt to impose rigid limits upon the mention of God or references to the Bible in the classroom would be fraught with dangers.Ah,which sounds a little bit different than what we're often told that the school prayer cases stand for.We're told that,uh,that,that those cases,ah,stripped all mention of God and,and study of the Bible out of the schools,and I think that that's part of that misinformation that we're dealing with here.I think the court thought they were going to be neutral,and I believe what the founding fathers really meant at the beginning was.A neutral as between one religious faith and another,they did not mean a hostility toward religion in general that would permit the establishment of the religion of nonreligion or the religion of situation ethics.That I think you're absolutely right,and I think that you state the case very well.Well,we're going to have to take another break.Dr.Dreisbach has a very fine packet on the subject of the constitutionality of religious holiday observances in public schools,which you can get by writing to the Rutherford Institute,Charlottesville,Virginia,22906 for a donation of $20.And Phyllis,you

**spk_0:** [46:17.07 - 54:37.21] Live via satellites on the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live 1-800-736-3202,and it's out to you,Indianapolis over WXIR.Here's Frank.Hello Frank,what is your question or comment?Well,I had a conglomerate of things that have gone through my mind since I've been listening to the program,and one is I often question whether this,whether the United States that we live in is a Christian nation.Ah,I believe that it is a religious nation,but a nation that's,ah,religion and Christianity are not necessarily the same.And,ah,you know,it,it would seem to me that if our nation were a Christian nation,then our president would not hesitate to pray as he leads our nation.We would fly the Christian flag.And when you think about things like what's going on in the schools and the nativity scene,prohibition,and all these sorts of things,I just wonder if it's pointing out the fact that our nation is not really a Christian nation at all.Well,let's get Doctor Dreisbach's comment on that.Oh,I,I,I agree.I think that,ah,in many ways the public institutions,the governmental institutions of our country reflect a secular religious order.I know that sounds somewhat contradictory,but,ah,insofar as the secular order speaks of,of a,of a moral or,ah,some kind of,of absolute values,then I think we live in a,in a secular society.Governed by the religious implications that that carries with it,and that's why it's so important that people who are Christians who believe deeply in their faith stand up in the public forum and share their viewpoints.And that's why it's important that we strive to ensure that the public forum is open for that kind of discourse so that Christian people and religious People of all shapes and sizes are free to share their view,and I think that's really at the heart of what we're talking about today is that,ah,in the public schools,uh,viewpoints from a variety of sources are free to be discussed and,and talked about except religious viewpoints,and,ah,that's why I think it's important that we strive to keep The arena open for discussion on these subjects.Well,nobody expects the schools to impose the Christian religion on public school students,but at the same time,they should not have this hostility or prevent them from expressing their views.Eric's listening in Pampa,Texas over KPDR.Hello Eric,what is your question or comment?Yes,I,well,I have a question,and I was wondering.Is it not impossible for a student in the public schools to,ah,violate the Establishment Clause?I am a public school teacher and I teach the actual history of the United States the way it was with the religious implications involved,but,ah,is it not impossible for a child to violate that clause?Well,um,I think it's,it's pretty close to impossible for the student to violate it,but let's hear what Doctor Dreisbach has to say.I think from a purely constitutional point of view it is impossible for a student to violate the Establishment Clause.However,there are a few instances where courts have said that a student in a particular activity or exercise is so much identified with the school.That that that student carries ah the mantle of state sponsorship ah with him or her,and in those instances you might find a court willing to say that the student is violating the Establishment Clause,but that's only because that student in a particular activity is so identified with the school and the authority of the school.Interesting comments.And now we move out to Trenton,New Jersey over WCHR.And here's Bob.Hello Bob.What is your question or comment?More along the lines of a comment.I work with a group called Teachers Saving Children,and one of the essays that we've put out is called Scriptures in Schools Project.It's legal ways to get things like Bible reading or at least Bible verses,ah,and prayer back into the public schools.There is one group of people that should be able to bring it in there with no problem,and it's been alluded to in the program already,and that's the children.One of the suggestions in the essay is that parents of Christian students that attend the public schools counsel and train their children to do certain things,like when the teacher assigns a book report.Do it on the book of Judges or Esther.Do it on a story out of one of the New Testament books.Um,there are plenty of secularized versions of these books,like,you know,little golden books of the Bible stories that the kids can use to do their book report from that perspective.Ah,when the teacher assigns something like a handwriting sample,do John 3:16,do the 10 Commandments.And if the teacher for some reason fails to post your child's handwriting sample on the bulletin board along with everybody else's,you have yourself a legal situation that could move the cause forward.And we're not advocating,uh,as the other side says,jamming our religion down anybody's throat,but by the same token,God's word won't return to him void.And if we do have this level playing field,this open market of ideas,any of our children's presentations in school like that tape recording someone mentioned,should be just as valid as anyone else's.Well,thank you,Bob.If you'll provide your literature to us at Eagle-Forum,we'll try to make it available to our listeners.Let's see if we can squeeze in one more call.Here's Elaine in St.Louis over Key SIV,about a minute.Hello Elaine.What's a quick question or comment?Quickly,I,it's my impression that there was a Supreme Court decision many,many years ago that declared that this is a Christian nation.Has this been,why can't we use that and has it ever been overturned,or what's the deal?Dr.Dreisbach,what's your answer to that?Yes,she's absolutely right.There are a number of court cases that say that,but I think while they've never been overturned expressly,they've pretty much fallen into,into disuse and,and the court has more or less ignored them,and that's kind of where we stand with those particular cases.We've been talking today with Doctor Dreisbach of the Rutherford Institute in Charlottesville,Virginia about Christmas.Observances in the public schools and we appreciate his joining us.It is,it is quite an important topic to many,many people.Do you think it's a rather recent phenomenon that these court cases analyzing public school practices in relation to the First Amendment are coming to the fore?Well,certainly in the in the last 20 years or so,the issue has taken on new meaning,and I look to see a lot more of these types of cases going into the courts and being litigated,and I think it's important that we understand what we stand for.We hope you with the Rutherford Institute will be right in there litigating,and I,I believe you will,Phyllis,a great guest and on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Too many children have been cheated out of the education they deserve.Did you know that nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science?That's a problem we can no longer afford to ignore.Educational excellence in the public school starts with respect for the rights of students,parents,and taxpayers.But what are they?Every student has the right to be taught to read the English language in the first grade.Every student has the right to family privacy,the right to his religious faith and beliefs,the right to share information with his parents.The Students Bill of Rights.Get your copy from Eagle-Forum.Learn
