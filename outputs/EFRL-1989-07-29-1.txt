**spk_0:** [00:01.62 - 00:11.72] In the old days,high school students took field trips to the zoo or museum.Today,a school field trip can mean going to a funeral parlor,a cemetery,or a crematorium.

**spk_1:** [00:13.75 - 00:49.41] Welcome to Philly Schlafly Live,and this is Bruce Hayes.One segment down the line,our second segment,of course,we'll be going to your telephone calls,and our number is 1-800-736-3202.Jot it down because we're looking forward to hearing from you on this matter.1-800-736-3202.You know,one of the trendy subjects being taught in public.Schools today is death education.Many schoolchildren are being given a strange course in death and dying.It's usually part of the health class.Phyllis,do you think that parents realize these gruesome subjects are being taught?

**spk_0:** [00:49.53 - 00:58.81] No,I certainly don't,especially since they're usually concealed within a course called health.Now you wouldn't think it would be very healthy to talk about death and dying,would you?

**spk_1:** [00:59.11 - 01:02.57] No,not in a course titled Health.Ah,it's a real paradox,

**spk_0:** [01:02.70 - 01:15.75] but they do strange things like having them write their own epitaph,uh,having them visit the cemetery,decide corpse disposal.Sometimes they have even taken them to lie in coffins in the funeral parlor to see what it feels like.

**spk_1:** [01:16.15 - 01:17.95] Sounds more like a Bella Lugosi movie.

**spk_0:** [01:18.18 - 01:39.61] Well,it,it,it is strange,but it's going on,and today,Our guest is Bruce Bartelli,who had a class on death education and suicide as part of his teacher recertification course,and then he actually taught death education.So we'd like to hear about this trendy new course straight from the horse's mouth,if you'll excuse the expression.

**spk_1:** [01:39.69 - 01:43.55] And from Pittsburgh,Kansas,we have Bruce Partelli on the line.Hello,

**spk_0:** [01:43.65 - 01:50.38] Bruce.Yes,thank you for joining us today.Tell us how you first encountered this course called death education.

**spk_2:** [01:50.98 - 02:23.58] Well,basically my education was in social science and sociology and psychology,and back when I had taught 4 years in the public school,uh,it was coming up as,as you said,the trendy thing.It's basically we were taught in higher education,uh.This is Of the teaching profession,particularly in sociology and psychology then is when it came up as to help the students' self-esteem,help them to be.Prepared to deal with life.

**spk_0:** [02:23.90 - 02:28.23] Well,could you explain to me how it helps your self-esteem to think about dying?

**spk_2:** [02:28.54 - 03:02.25] Well,in actuality it doesn't,and But of course,when we were in,uh,when I was in teacher training and as a professional teacher,they,they was taught that that was the thing to do.And Biblical basis when I was teaching as I do now and I Uh,basically what it comes up to do is really invades the student's privacy and,uh,if you'll allow me,I've got like a questionnaire,for example,uh,that we that I read to the students and they were required to answer this.

**spk_0:** [03:02.46 - 03:07.28] You mean you actually use this in one of your courses in education?Go ahead and read it.

**spk_2:** [03:09.24 - 03:26.69] Listeners an idea Education classes are asking their students or their,their sons and daughters,and I'll just read about a few of the questions.It says,who died in your first personal involvement.And I A grandparent,parent,brother,sister,multiple choice.

**spk_0:** [03:26.77 - 03:28.42] Well,that's none of the school's business.

**spk_2:** [03:28.88 - 03:29.21] Excuse me,

**spk_0:** [03:29.73 - 03:31.92] I don't think that's any of the school's business.Do you?

**spk_2:** [03:32.13 - 03:33.36] No,absolutely not.Well,

**spk_0:** [03:33.45 - 03:35.06] go ahead.What grade was this for?

**spk_2:** [03:36.11 - 03:56.95] to the best of your memory.were you first And You were a child.Talked about in your family,which of the following best describes your childhood conceptions of heaven and hell.The sleep cessation.Mental activity.Do you believe in life after death?

**spk_0:** [03:58.88 - 04:04.60] Well,basically that is the same thing as asking the child if you're religious,if you believe in life everlasting.

**spk_2:** [04:07.35 - 04:32.88] we're doing Uh Taking the role of the parent.When I came to the Lord Jesus Christ,I had to repent of this because I did not want that millstone.And there are teachers out there who are basically infringing on the rights of children and,and the family.family.Well,

**spk_0:** [04:36.27 - 04:53.69] when I debate,uh,some of these teachers who are promoting these psychological courses,their general argument is the parents aren't doing it.Therefore,the school must.The parents aren't talking about sex.Therefore,the schools have to talk about sex.The parents aren't talking about death.Therefore,the schools have to talk about death.

**spk_2:** [04:55.31 - 04:55.35] Well,

**spk_0:** [04:55.39 - 04:56.41] how do you answer that?

**spk_2:** [04:58.17 - 05:44.81] Basically,and I had the same battle with the school board here in Pittsburgh on sex education,is that it is not.Of education to get into family matters that they are usurping the rights of parents to do that and it's not the job of education.To,to so do that.Now,back when I was teaching,back then,I would have defended the,the NEA stand and so on.But,ah,education basically has come under what I call a fractured curriculum in that they've gotten away from the basics of,uh,mathematics,geography,reading,writing,literature,and gotten into more of the psychological aspects and are guiding our children more into,um,areas that are,should just be for the family.

**spk_0:** [05:45.12 - 05:48.93] Ah,Bruce,what grade did you teach this death education to

**spk_2:** [05:48.93 - 05:50.70] freshmen through seniors in high school.

**spk_0:** [05:51.51 - 05:53.76] And did the parents know what you were doing?

**spk_2:** [05:54.65 - 06:35.79] Not really.Most teachers have an.A very um autocratic type of system in their in the school,uh,even though they do follow lesson plans and some schools go to a very highly developed curriculum plan to where they have to.Certain lessons on certain days,the teacher still has a,a very,um,autocratic way of introducing anything he or she wants into the classroom.I could be,uh,we could be studying,um,oh,social institutions,for example,and like the Webster case on the Supreme Court came up and I could shift immediately to the abortion debate and integrate anything or personal beliefs or whatever.

**spk_0:** [06:36.08 - 06:38.85] Well,how many years did you teach this death education?

**spk_2:** [06:39.19 - 06:40.01] 3 years.

**spk_0:** [06:40.93 - 06:43.10] And was it part of the health course?

**spk_2:** [06:43.34 - 07:08.87] It was part of the sociology and psychology is where I integrated it in it was a normal progression,like we studied aging.From there went into,ah,ah,the family into aging,into child abuse and neglect,into,uh,death and dying,ah,and then from there you get into euthanasia,abortion,uh,you get into all kinds of different types of suicide and that type of thing.

**spk_0:** [07:09.21 - 07:25.57] Do you think that teaching the children about death and dying desensitizes them to the whole area of death and may make them more susceptible to Ah,believe that such things as suicide,euthanasia,or abortion are acceptable.Oh,

**spk_2:** [07:25.63 - 08:57.05] absolutely,and I can give you,uh,what it does is it,it promotes death as acceptable and,uh,particularly as a population control,and here's an exercise that is recommended,ah.Um,students.In the senior high school level I can find it,um.And there are just,there are just.Uh,that are available,here,here's one called Mathematics of Life and Death,and this is out of a book called A Guide to Death Education Discussing Death put out by the,uh.Publications of Homewood,Illinois.And in it it says discuss factors which have influenced the trend in certain statistics.What are the implications of the decreasing death rate?This notes to the teacher,this exercise would be a good introduction to discussing the population explosion and the controversy surrounding the trends in population growth.Teachers may want to refer to the limits to growth and the Malthusian theory of population growth.I had the same very uh Belief in population control.What it basically does is justify abortion as acceptable because they're unwanted.Ah,certain segments of,say,our,our society could be termed unwanted because the living have a right to live in a,in a well balanced life.And so why should we infringe.Well,you see death education then

**spk_0:** [09:02.78 - 09:15.42] as a,as a lesson in the school,ah,which promotes the idea that we have too many people on this earth and we should be more,ah,cheerful and accepting of,of death soon and often.

**spk_2:** [09:15.71 - 09:22.61] Ah,in some ways,yes.Now some,you know,and it just depends upon the teacher,but I think that as a general trend that is true.

**spk_0:** [09:23.00 - 09:32.07] Do you think that,ah,the death education courses in the schools open up the child to this new trendy belief in reincarnation?

**spk_2:** [09:32.89 - 10:00.25] Oh yes,and,uh,a matter of fact,I,I would take a survey every year in my class,and I would ask these,uh,students,and I would have,I'll say 150 to 200 students a year,and I would ask them how many of them are Christians,and probably about 98% would raise their hands,yes they are.And then I would ask them,well,how many believe in reincarnation and that they could come back as an animal or some other life form or something like that,and approximately 80 to 85% said they did.

**spk_0:** [10:00.57 - 10:02.27] But where did they get that nutty idea?

**spk_2:** [10:02.68 - 10:20.50] Well,I think they pick a lot of it up from the media.Ah,they also have no biblical foundation.Ah,they,they say they're Christian.I think a lot of the parents say they're Christian,but,ah,they don't know the word of God,and I think that,ah,and I didn't either when I was teaching,and that's really where I was wrong.

**spk_0:** [10:20.79 - 10:30.32] Well,in the teaching,in the teaching of education in the public schools,do you think they ever get around to discussing whether there is everlasting life?

**spk_2:** [10:31.22 - 10:53.24] Oh,I,I think,but it's not.When,when I did it,ah,it was more or less,ah,taken very lightly,you know,Jesus was never mentioned,never could be mentioned,but reincarnation or some higher enlightenment,and now the new age is,is a very strong influence.Ah,we would use Ouija boards,for example,and you know,it was just a game then.

**spk_0:** [10:53.68 - 11:01.30] Well,what happened after you realized what you were doing with education in the classroom?Did you continue to teach it or what?

**spk_2:** [11:02.07 - 11:05.93] And after the 3rd year,uh,3rd year,then I,I got out of education.

**spk_0:** [11:07.37 - 11:09.60] And so you're not,you're not a teacher any longer.

**spk_2:** [11:10.95 - 11:17.29] What I did then is work for a hospice unit,as director of volunteer services.And uh

**spk_0:** [11:17.73 - 11:26.18] Well,approaching the subject with a,a mature person is an entirely different question from dealing with it,uh,with children in the classroom,right?Oh,

**spk_2:** [11:26.27 - 11:51.23] absolutely,because the adult then when you deal with death education in the classroom,a teacher has no idea what kind of hidden agendas,what unresolved grief the child has,and in death education,the,the teacher's told to bring out the emotions and bring out the feelings.And kind of air their laundry in front of the whole class because that makes it more acceptable,makes it more willing for the students,and there's no fear of death.

**spk_0:** [11:52.12 - 12:38.35] We've had several complaints at our parents' advisory center about a child who was in the classroom when death education was taught who had recently lost her father or someone who was very close to her.Ah,then the classroom discussion becomes a very traumatic experience for the child.Ah,did you find that the,the whole idea of,ah,teaching the whole class with the individual,ah,ah,problems and family situations of the different children,ah,making the course react differently on different people?I mean,I can see where one child,it would just fall off him like water off a duck's back,but with another child who had just lost her father the week before,it just could be a very traumatic experience.

**spk_2:** [12:40.84 - 12:50.77] Oh,absolutely,and could be emotionally damaging and,and what the schools are asking is for a classroom teacher to become a psychologist,psychiatrist,whatever,

**spk_0:** [12:52.01 - 12:55.95] they're not trained for that.Were you,were you trained as a licensed psychologist?

**spk_2:** [12:56.80 - 13:14.01] No,I wasn't.I never was.A matter of fact,when I started teaching this,I had no workshop,no prior training,and most teachers only have maybe a workshop to kind of say this is the way to do it,and you fly by the seat of your pants.And so you know,it's very You know,I was very wrong to lead children that way.

**spk_0:** [13:14.25 - 13:20.57] How prevalent do you think deaf education is in the public schools?If it's out there in Kansas,it must be everywhere.

**spk_2:** [13:20.85 - 14:01.77] I would think so.Because,uh,like I said,it's trendy,and the suggested curriculum goes from kindergarten through 12th grade,and they not only have it like you said,in the health classes,I taught it in sociology,psychology,they recommend that,uh,the literature and English classes teach death education through literature and,uh,like the one exercise in mathematics and Malthusian theory,uh,population control,that mathematics even gets into it.Biology science classes,so they try,they have tried to really push death education K through 12,uh,in every aspect of the curriculum,and they're,and they're wanting to do it in sex education.

**spk_0:** [14:02.70 - 14:15.50] And of course that's all done without parental consent.In fact,the par the parents don't even seem to know about it.Well,thank you very much.Uh,we're out of time.Bruce Bartelli of Pittsburgh,Kansas,thank you for sharing your experiences with us.

**spk_1:** [16:39.99 - 16:56.78] From the USA Radio Network,this is P Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and this week we're talking about deaf education.Phyllis,you know,something that,um,uh,struck me right away in the conversation that you just had with Bruce Bartelli was that the public schools do not teach that there's an eternal life.Oh,

**spk_0:** [16:56.91 - 16:58.74] they couldn't do that.That would be religion.

**spk_1:** [16:59.05 - 17:07.33] Uh,how is it then they justify being able to teach the Death education and not the eternal life.It just seems like a complete contradiction.

**spk_0:** [17:07.49 - 17:13.47] Their argument is parents are talking to their children about death,therefore,the schools have to do it.How do you like that for a logical argument?

**spk_1:** [17:13.81 - 17:22.41] It's not,there's not much logic there.We're at 1-800-736-3202.Let's go out to Rome,New York,and here's Patricia.Phyllis.

**spk_0:** [17:22.54 - 17:24.15] Hello,Patricia.Good morning.

**spk_5:** [17:24.94 - 17:24.98] It's here.

**spk_0:** [17:26.89 - 17:30.57] All right,well,what is your comment about death education?

**spk_5:** [17:30.97 - 18:13.19] Well,the previous gentleman.Some of the points that I had intended to make,but some of the information that I was able to gather from the Arriany Central School District,uh,my nephew took in the 1st 10 weeks of this,uh,course,uh,death and dying and euthanasia.And all sorts of other,other things,values and clarification,all of the things that I had,uh,investigated myself and read in your book,uh,some time ago seem to be,uh,concentrated in this 1st 10 weeks of this particular health course.Some of the things are absolutely

**spk_0:** [18:13.37 - 18:14.99] appalling.Tell us something.

**spk_5:** [18:15.45 - 18:18.41] Um,let's see.Well,here's

**spk_0:** [18:18.95 - 18:23.52] and,and first of all,are you saying that this child had death education for 10 or 11 weeks?

**spk_5:** [18:23.81 - 18:26.09] Yes,10 weeks.Uh,well,

**spk_0:** [18:26.18 - 18:28.34] what could you talk about for 10 or 11 weeks?

**spk_5:** [18:28.59 - 18:41.75] Oh well,education was part of this 10 week concentration of values clarification.There's quite a bit here on death and dying and the exact amount of time that was spent on this particular segment.I'm not sure.

**spk_0:** [18:41.91 - 18:43.54] All right,well tell us some of the specifics.

**spk_5:** [18:43.70 - 19:14.87] He's one,question.If your parents grow old and are unable to take care of themselves,would you place them in a home for the age,let them move in with you,ignore them.I mean,none of these,uh,selections are.Uh,they don't make any sense,and they,I think they're designed to confuse the kids.Oh,I think that these kids are.Being subjected to things that,uh,adults,well educated adults don't have the answers.

**spk_0:** [19:15.16 - 19:26.72] They are certainly very difficult questions.Uh,what,what grade level was this at?Tell us some more things about what he got in deaf euthanasia.

**spk_5:** [19:30.74 - 19:57.60] Uh,you just read that a 19 year old boy was in a car accident that left him completely paralyzed with some degree of brain damage.Would you mark one A.Refrain from giving him medication that might save his life.B,keep him alive as long as his vital signs are normal or stable.C,ask him if he would like to live or die.Tell them of the consequences and then ask him what the doctor should do.Um,let him die.

**spk_0:** [19:58.90 - 19:59.74] How dreadful.

**spk_5:** [20:01.14 - 20:01.19] It's amazing.

**spk_0:** [20:03.66 - 20:24.43] Well,it's privacy invading and it's asking them or telling them that it's OK to make immoral choices.I'm sure that the underlying current of what you just read is that any choice you make or any,any choice the child makes is acceptable.The child is not going to get an A for one answer and an F for another answer.

**spk_5:** [20:28.60 - 20:47.48] Uh,that,that's true.It don't really have any educational value as far as I'm concerned.I don't understand what the,the objective is.I think that the suicide rate obviously is climbing.It's not declining.I think what they're doing in the schools is exacerbating the problem and not.Not rectifying it at all.

**spk_0:** [20:47.72 - 20:56.40] There are a number,there are a number of parents who believe that teenage suicides in their area have resulted from these death and dying courses.Well,

**spk_5:** [20:56.44 - 21:27.71] I'm glad that you mentioned that because,uh,my brother was 18 and he took his life.He attended this school or this,he took his own life.He was 18.He attended this particular school and it's the same school that my nephew.Uh,went to and gave me his notebook from this class.And so the question I have to ask is,did my brother,was he,was he subjected to this kind of education?Is this the straw that broke the camel's back?

**spk_0:** [21:28.29 - 21:30.33] Were you able to find out the answer to that question?

**spk_5:** [21:31.14 - 21:47.51] No,I was not.Um,at the time,I was a member of the board of education here in Rome,and to meddle in another school district's,um,business would have decreased my effectiveness on my own board.

**spk_0:** [21:49.59 - 22:16.17] Yes,I do see,ah,your personal reluctance,but,ah,we have had many parents who believe that the suicide was the result of the death and dying course in the schools,and it seems to be very difficult to get information.Ah,they don't give the books to the,to the parents.Ah,the teachers,or the books get changed before anybody makes an investigation.Ah,a school,ah,suicide is a very upsetting and traumatic experience for everyone.

**spk_5:** [22:16.95 - 22:36.55] As far as,as far as,um,getting my hands on any,uh,of the material from our own school district,I have not been able to do that,but I do know that the teacher Resource Center here in,uh,the city did hold a seminar on death and dying.

**spk_0:** [22:37.38 - 22:41.08] You mean for teachers.To teach them how to teach it.

**spk_5:** [22:41.90 - 22:42.73] I assume that that's what it was.

**spk_0:** [22:43.51 - 22:44.06] Uh-huh.

**spk_5:** [22:46.95 - 22:47.79] Well,even the teachers to use in

**spk_3:** [22:47.79 - 22:48.24] the classroom.

**spk_0:** [22:48.94 - 23:07.80] I think,uh,all of this should be laid out for the parents to decide whether they want their children to have this kind of course in the schools.Most parents think they're sending their children to school to learn how to read and write and history,geography,and mathematics.Well,well,thank you very much,Patricia.We appreciate your call.

**spk_1:** [23:07.99 - 23:20.47] And as a parent,how do you feel about public?Schools teaching death and dying.And indeed,if you're a student,how do you feel about learning about death and dying in the public schools?Let's see what Sharon has in Lincoln,

**spk_0:** [23:20.55 - 23:25.86] Nebraska.Hello,Sharon.Hello Phyllis.Do you have a comment on this subject for us?

**spk_3:** [23:26.54 - 23:40.25] Yes,this has happened to me in about November of 1986.I was cleaning our son's room,straighten it up,and I ran across his obituary and You mean

**spk_0:** [23:40.25 - 23:40.44] that

**spk_3:** [23:40.44 - 23:40.57] he

**spk_0:** [23:40.57 - 23:41.23] wrote himself,

**spk_3:** [23:41.65 - 23:41.66] yes,

**spk_0:** [23:42.10 - 23:43.91] uh-huh,and that was a classroom assignment,

**spk_3:** [23:44.57 - 24:19.61] right,in his health,uh,health class.It was a mental health unit of the health class,and it was,it was an,uh,they,it was part an optional part of it or something like that,but,um,it was a a feelings activity journal that the kids were doing and there was different things on there they could do,you know,and Anyway,uh,this is one of the things that my,our son did,and when I read a,it was his obituary and the words he wanted to have read at his funeral and what he wanted written on his tombstone.

**spk_0:** [24:19.78 - 24:22.90] What a gruesome thing for children to be assigned to write,

**spk_3:** [24:23.18 - 24:28.88] right?I was so shocked and so mad when I ran it.Trust it.I was,I was furious.But

**spk_0:** [24:29.41 - 24:30.91] what,what grade do you think that was,

**spk_3:** [24:31.47 - 24:39.47] at the time he was in the 8th grade,but in some of the newspaper clippings,it's also said that the 7th graders evidently were doing it too.So,

**spk_0:** [24:39.75 - 24:55.42] well,it's apparently very common to have children do an assignment to write their own obituary.It's being assigned in all kinds of classes all over the country.And you as a parent took a vigorous exception to that,right?Um,

**spk_3:** [24:56.77 - 25:15.16] I met with the curriculum counsel,the committee committee there,and I and another parent went with me and voiced our concerns about it because At the time there were a lot of suicides going on in Lincoln and Omaha,and I felt like it was these were contributing factors to it.

**spk_0:** [25:15.27 - 25:18.18] And what kind of reaction did you get from the schools?

**spk_3:** [25:19.32 - 25:22.38] They didn't say one way or the other if they agreed with us on that,of course,

**spk_0:** [25:23.16 - 25:25.08] but did they stop teaching it?

**spk_3:** [25:25.32 - 25:41.96] Yes,they did take,take it.We got a letter and they said that they were going to take it out of that.Out of that health class,I,I feel like they've got it somewhere.I'm sure it's in there somewhere else though,but they did take it out.They said of that health mental health class.Uh,

**spk_0:** [25:42.47 - 26:05.04] well,that was a very successful visit to the school then.I compliment you.I,uh,you,you took it up with them and told your objections,and,and you took another friend with you who had similar objections.That's really what parents should do.And I'm glad to hear that that was successful.Of course,the problem was it was given to your child without your knowledge or consent in the first place.

**spk_3:** [26:05.14 - 26:07.44] That's right.It made me mad.

**spk_0:** [26:07.86 - 26:10.46] Well,thank you very much,Sharon,for calling.

**spk_3:** [26:11.01 - 26:50.22] Phy.I did call.I talked to her name is Emma Jane Byers in Omaha Thursday,and I don't know,maybe you've had this on your program before because I haven't ever,I have,I can't get your program,I don't think,or I haven't heard it,but um.She was saying that across America that they are teachers are teaching from uh books by Shel Silverstein.Uh,and his,he's written,he's an author and he's written for Playboy and he writes different children's books,and one of the books that the teachers are using is called A Light in the Attic,and it has poems in it dealing with suicide,and she said they're really bad.

**spk_0:** [26:50.64 - 27:14.97] We have had a lot of complaints in our parents' advisory center about the use of the Silverstein books in the public schools,and you are correct,he is an author who also writes for Playboy magazine.And that seems a curious choice of an author for public school books with all of the great books that are available to be used in the public schools.So we'll be on alert for that.Thank you very much for calling,Sharon.

**spk_3:** [27:15.05 - 27:15.35] Yes,

**spk_0:** [27:15.80 - 27:17.37] we're about out of time.I know

**spk_3:** [27:17.37 - 27:26.93] there's LB 7517,which is pending in the Nebraska legislature this fall,and we're afraid that it's going to.Path and if so this will be mandated,you know,

**spk_0:** [27:27.29 - 27:28.43] mandated death education.

**spk_3:** [27:29.50 - 27:29.94] Oh

**spk_0:** [27:30.01 - 27:34.33] well,thank you for telling us about it.I didn't know any state had mandated death education.

**spk_3:** [27:34.41 - 27:37.23] It will be mandated if it's passed and we feel like it's going to pass.

**spk_0:** [27:37.30 - 27:40.78] Well,I hope you and your friends beat it.Thank you very much for calling,Sharon.

**spk_1:** [27:41.50 - 28:06.20] And a quick note that the opinions and views expressed on Phyllis.Slafly Live,of course,don't necessarily reflect the views of your station or its management.Well,we'll be looking forward to hearing from you in our next segment.We're at 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.Let's hear from you on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_6:** [28:19.12 - 29:15.66] Many children have been cheated out of the education they deserve.Did you know that nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science?That's a problem we can no longer afford to ignore.Educational excellence in the public school starts with respect for the rights of students,parents,and taxpayers.But what are they?Every student has the right to be taught to read the English language in the first grade.Every student has the right to family privacy,the right to his religious faith and beliefs,the right to share information with his parents.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy from Eagle-Forum.Learn more about the rights you and your children should expect.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy by writing Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [29:35.12 - 30:02.60] From the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and a quick reminder that,uh,if you'd like a cassette copy of today's program on death and dying in the public schools,we request that you send us $5 and we'll mail you a copy.Here's our address.It's.Forum Alton,Illinois 62002.And of course your gift helps us stay on the air via satellite.Well,Phyllis,let's jump back into telephone calls here and we go to Cynthia in Savannah,

**spk_0:** [30:02.67 - 30:05.86] Georgia.Hello,Cynthia,thank you for joining us.Yes,

**spk_7:** [30:06.07 - 30:35.03] um,I'm calling because we have deaf education in our public schools and uh I have and others have been trying to bring this to the attention of school board members and different right curriculum directors.But we,we've been trying for a year to try and change our sex education,and I don't anticipate we'll be very successful in trying to change the input that,uh,the curriculum they have in death and dying.We've just gotten some new health textbooks this year.

**spk_0:** [30:35.29 - 30:38.61] And do the health textbooks have a chapter on death and dying?Yes,they do.

**spk_7:** [30:38.65 - 30:59.40] The 8th grade one does,and the high school one is the one that I looked at,Prentice Hall Health Choosing Wellness,it's called.And it has a chapter on death and dying and discusses euthanasia and Kubler Ross,um,you know,her points of Of Uh,and so forth,we're very concerned and my little boy.

**spk_0:** [30:59.46 - 31:20.25] Well,I think you might,uh,you might even have better luck trying to get the death and dying education out of the schools than the sex education because people are so horrified when they hear about it.Well,what were you going to say?The line isn't very good and we're having a hard time hearing you,Cynthia.Speak right into the telephone and tell us quickly about your little boy.

**spk_7:** [31:20.37 - 32:24.49] OK,uh,my son came home and,and had an assignment where he had to write an epitaph,his own epitaph,and mail it to his friends.He's,uh,it was 4th grade,9 years old,but worse than that,then I was interviewing another friend who has another 4th grader in another local school here,and her little boy was,uh,put into a course of death and dying,and he came home and,and she didn't know about it until 2 days,2 classes after.And this alarmed us,and he came home very depressed,my little boy.It was kind of like a joke to him.It bothered me.And then when I saw in the health textbooks what they were doing and I asked the curriculum writer,a friend of mine,and I went down to see her and asked her,Are you going to be doing anything with death and dying this year?This was 2 weeks ago.She said,No,we're not because we don't have the trained teachers,but I'm very concerned about teen suicides.And so we were Told in so many words.It wasn't now,but it will be coming.

**spk_0:** [32:24.70 - 32:36.81] Well,keep an eye on it,Cynthia.I'm,I'm sorry.I'm going to close off this call because the line isn't the greatest,but we do appreciate your call and try to make every effort to approach the schools and keep it out.

**spk_1:** [32:36.97 - 32:51.26] And our toll-free number across America is 1-800.736-3202 drought of town and we hope to hear from you at 1-800-736-3202.Let's go out to Peoria,Illinois over WPEO.Phyllis,

**spk_0:** [32:51.31 - 32:55.66] here's Bob.Hello,Bob.Phyllis.Now have you got something to say about this subject?

**spk_8:** [32:55.90 - 33:35.40] I sure do.As a Christian funeral director,um,I'm kind of committed also to a form of death education.I have to agree with you,uh,along the lines of what's happening in the,uh,public school systems that I think that,uh,they've gotten involved in something that they probably have no business there.They're not able to,uh,take the information that they're distributing and provide the suitable kind of support that normally would come either from the family,from the clergy,or from some other professional support person.To that respect,I agree 100% with what you're saying about the death education problem in our education system.

**spk_0:** [33:35.72 - 33:59.22] As a funeral director,of course you deal with adults who are facing this problem all the time,and I'm sure you've worked out a way of coping with people's.Anxieties and trauma,but in the classroom you're,you're dealing with children whose family situation may be very different,who may not have to face death until they're grown,and why inflict it on them?It's an adult problem.

**spk_8:** [34:00.28 - 34:21.42] It is,and it's also a child problem because many of the problems that young people develop as they're growing older largely deal with their,um,inability to have dealt with a loss in the past.They weren't,uh,provided the kind of support either from their family or from their religious upbringing to help them to deal and address with those problems.

**spk_0:** [34:22.43 - 34:25.39] Yes,but the teachers are not trained to do that,

**spk_8:** [34:26.76 - 34:28.27] and I don't have any qualms with that argument,

**spk_0:** [34:28.43 - 34:35.13] right?And I would call it group therapy by unlicensed psychologists.What do you think of that?

**spk_8:** [34:35.23 - 34:53.22] I would think that that would be a fair observation.That's one of the reasons why myself and our staff have taken an initiative to provide a different forum for deaf education in the classrooms.And also in private and in public settings where we could have an audience where we could support.

**spk_0:** [34:53.40 - 34:54.52] Do you go into the schools?

**spk_8:** [34:54.60 - 34:55.44] Yes,ma'am,we do.

**spk_0:** [34:55.68 - 34:57.22] Do you teach a class in that?

**spk_8:** [34:57.64 - 35:09.64] Um,I don't teach an ongoing class.We are a resource for information on deaf education and primarily on the role in which our institution plays in our community as a support.

**spk_0:** [35:10.54 - 35:14.78] Do you get parental consent for those who come into your training session

**spk_8:** [35:15.22 - 35:21.62] when we have a private session or when we have tour groups that come in with younger children?You mean

**spk_0:** [35:21.62 - 35:23.26] tour groups that come to your funeral parlor?

**spk_8:** [35:23.34 - 35:43.15] That's correct.We normally have a complete information that we give out to those people in advance so that they're very clear on what it is that we're going to be sharing with them.Because we don't share the same kind of information,Phyllis,that you are talking about that's being disseminated in the classroom.We have a completely different approach to the subject.

**spk_0:** [35:43.26 - 35:50.36] Well,do you show them embalming?No.Or take them into the,uh,let them climb in the coffins or.

**spk_8:** [35:51.58 - 36:40.72] We let them become familiar with the environment because as they're familiar with it,they can get past,uh,the trouble of coming into a funeral home and then begin to really,uh,be a support perhaps to their family or to one another.We believe that when the families come in and they're going through loss,they need the support of everyone and if people refuse to talk about how they feel,I'm speaking more about adults,but the children are watching our role model.And so we as adults,especially as Christian adults,need to be sensitive to how our children are,are responding.And if our actions and responses or reactions are not stable,and in many cases they aren't,even for strong Christian people,our children will pick up on that.And,and what we're saying here is that the whole community plays a support role.

**spk_0:** [36:41.04 - 36:46.80] Well,thank you very much for sharing with us.We're going to move along to another call,and we're at 1-800-73.

**spk_1:** [36:46.96 - 36:54.92] 63202 from Kansas City's Christian Voice.John,you're on the line with America's foremost authority on education.Here's Phyllis.

**spk_0:** [36:55.04 - 36:58.94] Hello,John.Yes,do you have a comment on this subject?Well,

**spk_8:** [36:59.05 - 37:36.55] um,I'm a recent candidate for the Shawnee Mission School Board here in Kansas City,and early in the campaign I was,uh,uh,called and asked to review a textbook.Uh,the name of the book was Persons,uh,to Persons.And it had a chapter on deaf education and reviewing and talking with uh,the teachers that that taught the course,uh,they said that they had,uh,each,uh,teacher was allowed to decide how much time they wanted to spend on the subject,anywhere from a couple of hours to,to,uh,a week.

**spk_0:** [37:37.10 - 37:42.40] A week.What in the world would they talk about for a week on death and dying?

**spk_8:** [37:42.58 - 37:53.58] Well,I think as your previous caller was talking,they might go to a funeral parlor,then they might come back and write an obituary,things like that.

**spk_0:** [37:53.70 - 37:58.09] Well,don't you think that's just time taken away from history,geography,and mathematics?

**spk_8:** [37:58.34 - 38:23.42] Well,I certainly felt it was,and in the process of doing this investigation,the teachers I talked with then.Uh,expressed the,the fact that I was in and was reviewing the textbook and was asking questions and then it was put out to the press that that here was a man who was running for the school board who was going to censor a textbooks.

**spk_0:** [38:24.80 - 38:28.47] Just because you wanted to see it,right?That's a typical attack.

**spk_8:** [38:28.60 - 38:43.02] And,and the,the,the thing is,is I was asked by a patron in the school district to see if this course was being offered.It was not upon my own.A willingness to go look this up.It was a request from a patron.

**spk_0:** [38:43.26 - 38:50.38] Well,I think if you're running for the school board,you ought to be looking at the school textbooks.So thank you very much,John,for calling in.We appreciate your interest.

**spk_1:** [41:16.99 - 41:28.41] On the USA Radio Network this week,it's Death and Dying on Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we're taking your telephone calls right now.Let's go out to Vicky in St.Louis over KSIV.

**spk_0:** [41:28.59 - 41:33.52] Hello Vicky,it's your turn.What is your comment?Yes,can you hear me?Yes.I can hear you fine.OK.

**spk_7:** [41:33.61 - 43:04.58] I just would like to say that,um,when I was in my late twenties working on my master's degree,um,one of our college professors took us through a crematorium and we got to see how it works and everything,and I'd been in funeral homes because I'd had deaths in my family.And even at that age I was 25 or 26,um,it didn't make it any easier,and I,you know,I had,like I said I'd already experienced death of my father and a grandmother and my husband's grandmother and then I went to the crematorium.I'd never done that.I can appreciate what the uh person from the funeral home said a while ago that he thinks what he is doing is helping people,um,accept death a little bit more,but,you know,just as a human being.I don't think,I think regardless of the number of times you have to face death,it's never easy unless you have to face it every day,and,and I don't think any human being luckily has to do that,but,um,I think the facing of it when it comes right down to it.It should be the family because every family's response is going to be different.Their emotions are going to be different.The way they deal with it is going to be different,even if they're Christians.So I think,you know,the family should be the one to come to terms with it,for better or for worse.They may not do a good job at it,but I really think we're just,uh,tricking ourselves if we think taking trips.To funeral homes or talking in classes on death or dying is really going to ease the subject of death.It's a hard part of life.

**spk_0:** [43:04.82 - 43:21.83] I agree with you,Vicky,and if it was difficult for you in your twenties,you can imagine what it is to 1011,and 12 year olds,and I think the whole thing of accepting death is all a matter of whether you believe in life everlasting or not.That's what creates the acceptance.Well,thank you for calling,Vicky.We'll go to the next caller,

**spk_1:** [43:21.91 - 43:25.11] and it's Lamise in Athens,Alabama for Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [43:25.18 - 43:28.04] Hello,Lamisa,do you have an experience with death education?

**spk_9:** [43:29.23 - 45:13.27] Yes.First,I would like to make a comment from your child abuse in the classroom.The other lady that called saying there was mandated death education in the legislation.In your book it says the head of the Nebraska Board of Education told the principal of the Faith Christian Academy that fundamentalist parents have no rights to indoctrinate their children and their beliefs,saying that we are preparing them for the year 2000 and and life in a global one world society.So I imagine that's probably what they're doing that why they're doing that,uh,but what I've got going here in Athens,Alabama is my little boy in the 4th grade.Has played the computer game Oregon Trail and on that game he has written his epitaph and so I have uh gone to the principal and talked to the principal telling him it is a part of deaf education because the state board of education in,in August of '87 passed a resolution that would bring deaf education into the classes under comprehensive health curriculum.And I have,uh,they're denying that it's death education.The superintendent,the city superintendent here is denying it is death education.So I have filed under the Hatch Act a complaint with the federal Department of Education,and what they are telling me is that I have to approach the local people and the state people before they will conduct an investigation.So I have sent my information to a superintendent of education in Alabama,Doctor Wayne Tig.And trying to get the information that I need in order to fill this complaint out,and he just,I just got a letter back from him on the 14th,and he told me.That he cannot find out where those funds come from for that program,and that is something that I need to file this complaint.

**spk_0:** [45:13.46 - 45:32.28] That's right.You know that in order to file a complaint under the Hatch Amendment,you have to show that there's federal funding in it.So we don't know whether there's federal funding in the Oregon Trail software on the computer,but tell,tell our listeners what's on that Oregon Trail game.

**spk_9:** [45:32.86 - 46:37.51] Uh,there is a scene in there where like,uh,the child,it's a life death survival game is what it is.The child starts out and he has to make decisions and if he makes the wrong decision,he dies or a party with him dies and there's a,a frame in there where you can go in and see the,the,at the tombstone you can see the tombstones going to the cemetery and once you go into the cemetery,what you see is you see the epitaph that the last child wrote on the computer.And then,uh,once the final person dies,like you've got 5 names that are clued in,and once the final person dies,he writes his epitaph.And from what I'm reading that that is a death education exercise in suicide prevention,and it is a death education exercise in drug ed death ed curriculum,but these people here are telling me that even though it's on there,it's a non-academic program,he does not have to play the game if he doesn't want to,and they're not seeing it as being death education.As a matter of fact,my superintendent,my city superintendent Dr.Wayne Reynolds,is telling me that the state is not even teaching death education that was mandated two years ago on a resolution.

**spk_0:** [46:37.91 - 46:41.15] Well,do people die on the Oregon Trail game?

**spk_9:** [46:41.43 - 46:42.69] Yes,everybody dies.

**spk_0:** [46:43.40 - 46:44.03] You dies.

**spk_9:** [46:44.47 - 46:48.61] Everybody dies.You either conquer the computer or everybody dies.

**spk_0:** [46:49.37 - 46:56.10] Did you,did you play the game yourself?Do you really know this from firsthand experience?So what happened when you,when you played the game?Well,

**spk_9:** [46:56.21 - 47:30.34] I clued in my name and my 4 sons' name,and immediately I was caught in a compromising situation and made the wrong decision.And when that happened,my youngest son fell off the wagon,and the computer said Taz fell off the wagon.And so on the next screen,you know,I mean like there wasn't even,I could help,I couldn't even help him.And then on the next screen it said Taz died.And then my children just continued to get diseases and then we ran out of food and they got shot by the Indians and it was just,uh,I mean,you know,everybody died and like the more I played the game,

**spk_0:** [47:30.45 - 47:31.69] now did you die at the end?

**spk_9:** [47:32.23 - 47:50.60] Yes,I died and then I got to write my epitaph and I wrote mother of four for my epitaph and then the next day when my son went to that class,one of his little friends was playing it.And this little boy went into the tombstones and there appeared my epitaph,and he goes,Hey,Brescia,and here's your mama's epitaph,and everybody came over to look at it.

**spk_0:** [47:51.30 - 48:05.52] Well,Lamisa,thank you very much for telling us about this.I have not heard of that Oregon Trail.It certainly sounds like it's clearly about death and dying,and it is non-academic,and we wish you well in your approach to the school to get it taken out.

**spk_1:** [48:05.73 - 48:15.83] Phyllis,real quickly before we do have your closing comments,is there a correlation Between the high teen suicide rate and the onslaughts of deaf education in the public schools,

**spk_0:** [48:16.15 - 48:24.66] that's a very interesting subject.We'll have to take that up in another broadcast.Many people have charged that,even some of those who were interviewed by Sam Donaldson on ABC television

**spk_1:** [48:24.84 - 48:28.35] and on the USA Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [50:34.48 - 51:11.20] Death education is being taught in more and more schools.We've learned today some of the varieties of it,including writing your own epitaph,going to funeral homes,visiting the embalming room or the crematorium.It's often and usually taught in a health class,and I urge you to check into it.Most parents don't have any ID.what is happening and this course is taught apparently with the idea of changing people's attitudes about death and convincing them that there are too many people in the world today,so we should be more tolerant about abortion,euthanasia,and suicide.We'll talk more about suicide education next week.
