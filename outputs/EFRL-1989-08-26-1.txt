**spk_0:** [00:01.67 - 00:11.60] Surveys show that 33% of young adults cannot read at all and another 1/3 cannot read above a 5th grade level.Have we become a nation of illiterates?

**spk_1:** [00:13.63 - 00:50.44] Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.I'm Bruce Hayes.Another exciting program about what's going on in the public schools,or should we say,what's not going on in the public schools.Today we'll explore the question of why the schools are not teaching children to read,and we'll be ready to take your calls just about 15 minutes at 1-800-736-3202.Make a note of that number.1-800-736-3202.And Phyllis,I think we should note that we've got a couple new stations KLHT,Honolulu,WCHF.That's in Bangor,Maine.

**spk_0:** [00:50.63 - 00:52.72] You couldn't get two stations farther apart.

**spk_1:** [00:53.03 - 01:03.65] No,no,sir,but we're glad to have them on board.Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Phyllis,the matter of teaching children to read,it's become One of your primary interests for many years,hasn't it?

**spk_0:** [01:03.80 - 01:37.47] Indeed it has.I taught all my 6 children to read before they entered school because in checking out the schools available in my area,I found that none of them taught children to read.They just taught children to guess.And so when we started Eagle-Forum Education and Legal Defense Fund,A phonics reading course was our first project,and today we're going to talk first of all to the president of the Reading Reform Foundation,which is an organization that's been working for many years about reform in reading methods.

**spk_1:** [01:37.66 - 01:44.02] And on the line from the state of Washington,Mrs.Marion Hines,president of Reading Reform Foundation.

**spk_0:** [01:44.19 - 02:18.14] Hello Marion,are you there?I am here,Phyllis.Well,thank you for joining us today.I note in a recent statement by US Secretary of Education Laurel Cavasos,he said that 13% of our citizens are illiterate,27 million are functional illiterates,and another 40 to 60 million could be called marginally literate.You really couldn't have a more devastating indictment of what's been going on in the public schools,could you?

**spk_2:** [02:19.11 - 02:21.05] Phyllis,I can just barely hear you.

**spk_0:** [02:21.42 - 02:50.63] Well,I'll try to speak up louder,and I hope you will too,and we're talking about the many millions of young adults who have been through the public schools in the last few years but have not learned how to read or read well.I know in your reading reform Foundation you've devoted yourself to uh the uh the problems with reading methods and what is your your primary conclusion of all the research that you've done?

**spk_2:** [02:51.73 - 03:15.87] So,our position of the Reading Reform Foundation has been based on um the reviews that uh Doctor Jean Shaw from Harvard University,uh,Doctor Patrick Graf,and others of the,uh,researchers,and in reviewing all of the research.is supporting an alphabetic approach.I think you know that.

**spk_0:** [03:16.21 - 03:19.54] Is that what we call the phonics approach,a phonics approach

**spk_2:** [03:19.54 - 03:25.13] sometimes referred to as decoding.That's what Dr.Shaw referred to it,although she's using the term phonics more now.

**spk_0:** [03:26.35 - 03:40.40] Well,Marion,most of us cannot remember learning to read ourselves,and I find in talking on this subject.That most people really do not understand what phonics means.Would you give us a simple explanation of that?

**spk_2:** [03:40.54 - 04:38.47] Yes,uh,the simplest way that we can describe it is simply teaching the sounds that we use in our spoken English.That,uh,represent the written letters and,uh,sometimes there's a combinations of letters,uh,sometimes it's only one letter,but understanding that relationship between the sounds and the written letters,how they function in words going left to right and in simple terms,properly taught.This can be done very quickly and it's generally considered as the first step in reading and comprehension just simply follows.If you're given accurate information.And you are given plenty of practice and fluency develops and comprehension just moves right in and There shouldn't be all of these learning disabilities.There should not be all of the failure that we're having now.

**spk_0:** [04:39.18 - 04:50.24] The opposite point of view is teaching the child to guess at the configuration of the word and relate it to a picture on the page.And would you call that a guessing method?

**spk_2:** [04:50.86 - 05:21.38] Well,I think most people do when they compare the two.Of officially,the method that is not an A phonics method or based on the alphabet is referred to sometimes as the whole word sight method,let say,and now more recently the whole language,which is asking children to not just read a whole word and memorize it but to look at phrases and sentences and in some cases not even given that much help.

**spk_0:** [05:23.52 - 05:27.12] And but it's basically,it's basically a guessing method,isn't it?Yes it is because

**spk_2:** [05:27.12 - 05:56.99] the students are not given.Sometimes,any information regarding the letters and their sounds and so they're relying on pictures and they're relying on context clues that sometimes are very sketchy.And so it is essentially a guessing way and uh sometimes it's called,uh,they're called miscues,but those are just other,other terms to uh uh cover the issue of not knowing the letter sounds and how they function.

**spk_0:** [05:57.56 - 06:26.54] As opposed to the phonics method,which is teaching the child the actual sounds and syllables in the words in the English language.Well,now tell me,with your reading Reform Foundation,I'm sure you've studied a lot of the research on this subject.In fact,with all the money,the billions of dollars we pour into education,there must be enormous research on what reading methods work and what and which ones don't work.And what is your conclusion from that?Well.

**spk_2:** [06:26.85 - 07:14.95] The only thing that we are concluding uh is that the research is being ignored and uh we rely on the um researchers to tell us this.Uh,we see it in practice,but,uh,Doctor Patrick Graf,for example,has,uh,surveyed the teachers colleges.And review the textbooks that they are using.Uh,the textbooks are generally written by the professors.They use those books in their teacher's classes,and then they are also the authors of the textbooks that are used in our,uh,primarily,primary and elementary classrooms.And what he has concluded is that they simply ignore the research.They,um,Right on using the failing methods that we've been using since the 1920s and um

**spk_0:** [07:15.72 - 07:25.22] And the teacher,the teachers today,uh,did not have phonics themselves.I find that a lot of them don't even really understand what we're talking about.

**spk_2:** [07:26.07 - 07:58.94] That is correct.And,uh,Doctor Graf,for example,has,uh,found this and the,the,uh,real tragedy of this.Is that uh They,when they come into the classroom,they don't have any background,uh,having gone to a let's say program themselves.They do not get the methodology in the teacher's courses and then they go out into the classroom and are expected to use whatever is there and those programs are,um,let's say,or Word or whole language.

**spk_0:** [07:59.49 - 08:24.40] I hear the argument.I hear the argument made that that reading should be taught rather informally.The child will,will pick up the skills as he goes along.Do you favor a systematic intensive phonics instruction at that point where you've decided it's time for the child to learn to read?

**spk_2:** [08:25.51 - 09:12.60] The,all of the research again,the empirical evidence,uh,and again I'll refer to Doctor Shaw because her,her work is a monumental work in reviewing the research,but Doctor Groff has done a great deal of writing on this too.All of the research favors.A direct instruction,simply telling the children and Expecting them to learn it by giving the proper help that when you have the letter B that it says.If you have the letter A,that it can say three sounds,a,a,uh,the,the evidence is overwhelming that children learn better when they are given this direct instruction and told how this works.

**spk_0:** [09:13.67 - 09:23.82] American children were,were very much taught by the phonics method from the start of our country until probably around the 1940s,weren't they?

**spk_2:** [09:24.46 - 09:36.90] Well,uh,I think that's when we really began to see the,um,the,uh,Manifestation of it was in the 20s,late 20s and 30s when it really got started.Now which

**spk_0:** [09:36.90 - 09:37.74] really got started?

**spk_2:** [09:38.02 - 09:38.94] The,the,

**spk_0:** [09:41.30 - 09:44.41] the look,but it was very experimental in that decade,wasn't it?

**spk_2:** [09:44.78 - 09:56.73] We didn't see it so much until a little later because we still had many,many teachers in the classroom who,uh,as one teacher says,bootlegged phonics.They went ahead teaching it because they had it up in their heads.

**spk_0:** [09:57.05 - 10:19.18] Yes,I,I have a friend who bootlegged phonics when she was told to use the same method,and pretty soon the parents found out about it and they kept applying to the school to transfer their children into her class and the school tried to stop her from using font.But she went right ahead until,till finally she quit.She didn't want to fight it any longer.

**spk_2:** [10:20.41 - 10:47.25] We were speaking earlier that the teachers aren't trained now.Um and this is an obvious,uh,an obvious difference that we see.The,the other thing that started showing up in the 40s,I think that people don't always realize is that After a little while,so many other things changed.It wasn't just a matter of not being taught to read,but they started doing,uh,other things like dumbing down the curriculum.

**spk_0:** [10:48.10 - 11:03.22] Well,if you can't,if you can't read and you don't have any vocabulary except the few 100 words that you've been taught to memorize,then obviously the textbooks in the 5th,6th,7th,8th,9th,and 10th grades have to be dumbed down or you're hopelessly lost.

**spk_2:** [11:03.54 - 11:53.92] That's true,and I think that a lot of people didn't realize what was happening.And then we also had this social promotion,you see.Uh,children were being sent along the grades without having learned the skills,and this is true of math also.And so,um,we not only have the dumbing down,we have the children being passed along who couldn't read,and right now,the figures are that,uh,we are graduating close to 1 million a year from our high schools who cannot read and another,uh,approaching another million dropping out.Who can't read.So,you see,we're beginning to see,we have been seeing since the 40s many manifestations of what originally started out with the most devastating of changes from the alphabetic phonics.

**spk_0:** [11:54.28 - 12:06.52] If they can't read,they can't hold anything except a minimum wage job and even at that,it's difficult because you ought to be able to read the safety instructions and the road signs on the way to work.

**spk_2:** [12:06.98 - 13:22.11] Yes.Uh,one of the things that I think people are not realizing,and this is why we try to emphasize for everyone to think in terms of the big picture,the phonics may be the tip of the iceberg,and it's the,the beginning of all of this,um,sort of a domino effect.But,uh,when we see,uh,in the business world that,um,I don't know.I think it's something like $25 billion a year being spent by businesses to give just a minimum basic skills training.We know that uh they are having to interview thousands of people to just get a handful for every job.We are also um facing many of these people in critical areas who can't read.Uh remember one instance of someone um Made out a check for $2 million instead of $2000.Um,when you have,uh,people who make errors that cost something like $700 there are even worse,uh,situations where you have in medicine a misreading.Uh,it's,it's a misreading

**spk_0:** [13:22.11 - 13:25.51] of the prescription or the instructions on the medicine bottle,

**spk_2:** [13:25.63 - 13:57.19] right?Yes,all of these,and when you add,I think we have 80% in prison.Who can't read.Uh,we have at a very early age put youngsters in a position of not being successful,and these bright children,and they are bright children who don't learn to read,uh,are going to find other areas to find success.So we're leading.We're leading all of these youngsters when they can't read into all sorts of problem situations.

**spk_0:** [13:57.38 - 14:10.82] If they,if they don't learn how to read in the first grade in school,then you wonder what in the world they do all those other 11 years in school.It's just marking time.It's discussing.It's looking at pictures.It's getting into mischief.

**spk_2:** [14:11.09 - 14:43.68] Yes,that's true,and Also,of course,uh,we have um many reports from teachers,uh,some of them in special education themselves telling us that these youngsters come to school,they're bright,they can be taught,but they're not being taught,and so even kindergarten children are being labeled as,um,special education,learning.Disabilities and when you have kindergarten children with that label and some of those labels stay with children the whole year,you have children that are not feeling very good about themselves in the very beginning.

**spk_0:** [14:43.88 - 14:56.14] That's right,Marion.Uh,we have to break for announcement.We're talking to Marion Hines,president of the Reading Reform Foundation in the state of Washington.Uh,stand by and we'll talk to you after the break.

**spk_1:** [14:56.26 - 15:13.44] 1-800-736-3202.Maybe we happen to be talking this morning to one of those functional illiterates,Phyllis,maybe you'll have some advice to pass along to them.Stay with us via satellites on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly live.

**spk_3:** [15:15.57 - 16:16.84] A national panel reported that 25% of 17-year-olds are functional illiterates.Another 40% are marginal illiterates.That means nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science.What have they been doing all those years in public schools?Sex education,death education,new age meditation,and other non-academic psychological activities.This can be stopped.US law gives you,the parents,primary control over your children's education.Find out about your rights.Read the Education Reporter.It's a monthly newspaper from Eagle-Forum.The Education Reporter keeps you informed about offensive school curricula and about victories won by parents who assert their rights.Write for a free sample of the Education reporter.The address Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.That's Eagle-Forum.Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_4:** [16:17.09 - 17:16.22] Too many children have been cheated out of the education they deserve.Did you know that nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science?That's a problem we can no longer afford to ignore.Educational excellence in the public school starts with respect for the rights of students,parents,and taxpayers.But what are they?Every student has the right to be taught to read the English language in the first grade.Every student has the right to family privacy,the right to his religious faith and beliefs,the right to share information with his parents.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy from Eagle-Forum.Learn more about the rights you and your children should expect.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy by writing Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [17:17.66 - 17:42.44] On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly live and jot down our toll-free number from anywhere in America.We're via satellites on the USA Radio Network 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.We'll pick up the tab on the call and let's travel out to Houston over KTEK.Here's Margaret for Philly Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [17:42.58 - 18:36.18] Hello,Margaret.What is,what is your question or comment?Right,well,we'll try to talk up and you do too.Can you hear me all right?Yes,fine.Um,I taught for 32 years.I'll be 81 in October and I now tutor.Uh,I went to school when I was going to school.I was never taught phonics.I taught in Fort Worth and Dallas and never taught phonics.We were never told to.We didn't know what it was about and finally my last year there,which was the year of 5556,we received a book with phonics in it,a reader,and we didn't know what to do with it.The next year I came to Houston and they were well into the phonics program.Um,I didn't know much about it and began working on it,went to the University of Houston and studied up on with the books that they had over there in the library,

**spk_2:** [18:36.48 - 18:50.90] and I found that there were some difficulties in learning about phonics myself and that there were too many rules.Many of them were poorly written,and eventually I boiled them down to 7 rules.

**spk_0:** [18:51.55 - 19:56.59] And I now teach that way and I think it's just wonderful.I can remember in the 3rd grade,we all stood up in a line and our teacher called on us to read.And I remembered the word um.Hunger.I've pronounced it hungry because I knew that word,and she told me it was hunger,and I wondered why and never did know.Well,phonics explains why.So now I just love phonics.I've boiled the rules down to 7,get along just well,and I remember reading and I,um,it unlocks the pronunciation of words and I remember reading a columnist here in one of the papers in Houston who wrote every week,every day about just home things,neighborhood things.And she said,my daughter asked me how to spell a word,and I said,Well,look it up in the dictionary,she said,and the daughter said,Well,how can I don't know how to spell it?And the columnist said,Well,that's true.If she didn't know how to spell it,she wouldn't know how to look it up.And I thought if she knew phonics she would.That's right,look up words that way.

**spk_2:** [19:57.22 - 20:07.05] But if you know the different sounds of a letter or letter combinations and you need to learn good rules,have just a few rules and just good ones.

**spk_0:** [20:07.38 - 21:44.47] Well,that,thank you very much,Margaret.I hope you'll drop us a line at Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002,and you tell us what your seven rules are so we can share them.But it,it is great,it is great that you found out finally and realized the importance of phonics.Uh,I think,uh,people should know that once you've learned the wrong way,it is more difficult to,uh,to learn the right way.It's just like,uh,any.The golf instructor would tell you that he would rather teach somebody who had never swung a golf club than somebody who's been swinging a club the wrong way for the last 10 years,and I have something to add.All right,what is it?I found,I find in my tutoring that,uh,of course they've stopped teaching phonics in my school district even though I'm Houston.I'm in the uh the Aleaf Independent School District.And they've stopped uh teaching phonics,but I find this in tutoring the children,you know,learning phonics,and if you feed the children a good program,that means a great deal of concentration,and they don't want to work anymore.They get,they begin to rebel against,uh,learning whereas used to when I would tutor that wasn't true.They all just loved it.So I think children are getting.Lazy habits.That's why I think it's most important that they learn in the first grade before they acquire all those lazy habits.Learning itself is very,very exciting.Well,thank you very much for calling,Margaret.We appreciate it.

**spk_1:** [21:44.72 - 21:53.64] I've got a quick question.Is it too late?Let's say we're talking to one of those functional illiterates.Can they relearn once they've been taught the wrong?

**spk_0:** [21:53.98 - 22:07.71] Well,of course you can learn.All you need to do is get a good phonics book,and we do sell one through Eagle-Forum,but it is harder when you're grown up.This is why we hope to get to the 5 and 6 and 7 year olds and teach them the right way first.

**spk_1:** [22:07.86 - 22:15.89] Boy,do it while you can.We're at 1-800-736-3202.What do you say we travel out to Huntington,New York,and here's Charles.Hello,

**spk_0:** [22:15.91 - 22:18.46] Charles.What is your question or comment?

**spk_5:** [22:19.42 - 23:16.59] I'm delighted to be part of the show,and I haven't heard any of the previous comments,but I've been working to bring the message about the need for literacy in the schools to the business community to get them more involved.The American Association for the Advancement of Science is on a campaign via their Project 2061.To,uh,to bring about scientific literacy in the whole US population.And of course my feeling is that they have to deal with the basic literacy problem before we can achieve scientific literacy and everything that you've said about the need to get to the kids at the age of 56,and 7 is extremely important.Those are very.impressionable,vulnerable ages,and it's very important that they be taught right at that level.

**spk_0:** [23:16.79 - 23:20.09] You sound like you must be an engineer.You're thinking so logically.

**spk_5:** [23:21.55 - 23:24.90] Thank you.Yes,I am an engineer.Did you have previous information on that?

**spk_0:** [23:25.43 - 23:46.17] No,we didn't.We were talking about the reading by the phonics method,but of course you Mentioned scientific literacy.We need that too,but you've got to be able to read the science books before you get to scientific literacy,right?Absolutely,absolutely.So have you been tutoring children or what is your particular interest in this?Yes,

**spk_5:** [23:46.30 - 24:58.29] I've been involved in education for almost 20 years as owner,director of a learning center for a while and a private tutor.I even spent A year as an adjunct professor of reading and special education at a college,and that was an eye opener of how things are going astray.And so with what I've learned with all that exposure,I'm just devoting most of my time to try and bring the business,the the message to the business and scientific community,because if you think about the national scene at the moment,the Uh,the education establishment has the politicians very much confused and cornered in many cases,and,uh,the public at large just doesn't have the organization or political clout to do very much.And so who's left really the business community,the scientific community,the technical societies really are the,uh,are the last hope of some kind of an organizational.Bulwark with some intellectual and political clouts to do anything about it.Well,

**spk_0:** [24:58.34 - 25:36.35] that sounds very reasonable,Charles,but my experience of business getting interested is they meet with the educators and the educators tell the businessmen that the educators are the experts and they know how to do it.And will you,Mr.businessman,just put up some money.And the money goes into the same old methods.I've watched this happen again and again in different parts of the country,and you wonder why don't the businessmen demand the type of accountability of throwing out the people who've done a bad job that they would require if they were investing their money anywhere else.

**spk_5:** [25:36.55 - 26:12.24] They haven't done their homework yet,and that's exactly what I'm trying to tell them.I have written a couple of things that I will send to you.And they describe exactly that phenomenon,and they have been distress signals coming out from the inside the educational community for years,and the business community has not been perceiving those signals.These go all the way back to a report that was commissioned by the National Academy of Education back in 1975 where it mentioned the need for private sector involvement.

**spk_0:** [26:12.71 - 26:18.36] Well,we wish you well in that effort and thank you for calling.We appreciate what you're doing.

**spk_1:** [26:18.60 - 26:31.22] We've added more lines,by the way,at 1-800-736-3202 because of the tremendous response that you've had over the last few weeks,Phyllis.Here's Janet in Suring,Wisconsin,WRVM.

**spk_0:** [26:31.72 - 26:42.15] Hello,Janet.What is your question or comment?I can hardly hear you.Well,we'll try to speak up.What did you have to say about the subject of reading and literacy?Uh,

**spk_2:** [26:42.26 - 27:20.81] I had a very personal experience with it with my children,and it's,uh,I agree with you wholeheartedly about phonics.My two older boys.were in school and they did have phonics.My youngest boy did not have phonics and He was having a lot of difficulty in reading.He stayed in the 1st grade for 2 years and he still wasn't ready for the 2nd grade when he was put to the 2nd grade.So we had put him in a special education,uh,class,and he's done very well.And then,

**spk_0:** [27:21.00 - 27:23.43] then did he learn how to read in special ed?

**spk_2:** [27:24.47 - 27:28.71] But the special education teacher was simply teaching phonics.

**spk_0:** [27:29.84 - 27:48.18] Well,it's very sad that the child has to spend 2 years in the 1st grade wasting time and then only gets phonics when he goes into special ed class.Is that what happened to your child?Yes,it is.But did you complain to the school?Yes,I have,and they told you you were just a mere parent.

**spk_2:** [27:49.74 - 28:07.17] Complained and well,this is some time.My son now is 20 years old,but then he did,I did put him in a private school and They had phonics there and he done very well and he is now a diesel mechanic and he graduated with honors.

**spk_0:** [28:07.46 - 28:17.22] Well,I'm glad you were able to help him and of course a mechanic has to be able to read the instructions in order to run the machinery.So thank you very much for calling,Janet.And I would

**spk_2:** [28:17.22 - 28:23.34] like to advise any parents that have this problem that they should go right straight to the state and complain.

**spk_0:** [28:23.99 - 28:28.99] Well,thank you for that piece of advice,and I'm glad you were successful with it.You know what,

**spk_1:** [28:29.11 - 28:40.89] Phyllis,I've read that so many colleges are spending a lot of money these days to offer remedial courses because the people who they're accepting,even the people who they're accepting,can't read.

**spk_0:** [28:42.28 - 29:05.36] It's too bad when we have to pay twice and even 3 times for the same product.I think that we should have a consumer revolt about the bad product that is being turned out by the public schools.There's no.The reason why business and colleges and the armed forces should have to pay all over again to teach people what they should have learned in school.

**spk_1:** [30:25.31 - 30:45.59] Via satellite from the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Hope you're enjoying the program today.We're finding out a lot about the problem of illiteracy in America.If you'd like to jump in on this conversation,we'd certainly like to hear from you,toll-free from anywhere in the United States.1-800-736-3202.

**spk_0:** [30:45.92 - 31:07.69] Our guest.In the earlier part of the program was Marion Hines,president of the Reading Reform Foundation headquartered in Tacoma,Washington,and we have so many calls.I just have one more question for you,Marion,before we let you go.Uh,would you make a comment on the adult literacy programs that we hear so much about?Uh,what do you think?Are they doing a good job or not?

**spk_2:** [31:08.50 - 32:02.26] What we're finding is that there is a great deal of effort being put forth and many millions and millions of dollars being spent,but many of these programs are not using the kind of direct teaching of intensive phonics that will overcome the problem.Uh,too many of the programs have,um,the same kinds of techniques that are used in,and failed in the first place.And I think it's important,um,as a Anyone evaluating.Even if they have gone through a program,you should go back to the very beginning as in any skill and be sure that they have the basic information and in reading that is knowing the letters and the sounds of those letters,how they go from left to right to form the words.

**spk_0:** [32:02.39 - 32:22.55] In other words,you think phonics is the key to reading no matter what age you're trying to learn.There's no question about it.Well,we,we thank you very much for joining us.We've got a whole phone bank full of calls waiting,and your,your reading form address will be in the packet we offer on to people who write in.Let's go to our next call and we will

**spk_1:** [32:22.55 - 32:38.64] quick reminder.Available to you that packet is for $10.Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.If you try in,the number's busy,try back again at 1-800-736-3202.Out to Midland City,Alabama.Here's Pansy.Hello,

**spk_0:** [32:38.72 - 32:48.06] Pansy.What is your question or comment?I just have a comment that I would like to make regarding.Bon,I was born in.

**spk_1:** [32:51.40 - 33:01.41] We're really going to have to ask you to speak up.Taught me at home.I was the age of

**spk_0:** [33:11.64 - 33:12.04] And all

**spk_1:** [33:12.04 - 33:15.60] the basics.She didn't have any training or anything.

**spk_0:** [33:17.87 - 33:32.91] OK,well,good for you,Pansy.Uh,I,we're having a little difficulty with that phone line,but basically she is saying that her mother taught her to read before she entered to school,and that's exactly what I did with my children,and I recommended and she recommended.I think you can hear better

**spk_1:** [33:32.91 - 33:34.87] than all of our listeners.That was

**spk_0:** [33:34.87 - 33:36.89] amazing.So let's go to the next call.

**spk_1:** [33:37.02 - 33:39.49] Franconia,New Hampshire.Here's Charles Phyllis.

**spk_0:** [33:39.74 - 33:42.45] Uh hello Charles.What do you have to say about this subject?

**spk_7:** [33:43.27 - 34:43.79] Well,regarding phonics,I've been a superintendent of schools,principal teacher all my career,27 years of it,and I had an opportunity to establish through the auspices of the Reading Reform Foundation about 10-12 years ago,ah,an intensive phonics program in three rural communities up here in northern New Hampshire.Ah,it was amazing what that program did for my youngsters and my teachers and the communities.New Hampshire,as most people know from,ah,the,ah,report cards that are issued periodically from the Department of Education,is very nearly,ah,at the top and nearly always at the top on the scholastic aptitude tests and so forth,ah.Ah,my school districts were very near the top within the state,which I felt was rather remarkable considering the kind of communities that we were serving.Ah,very high unemployment,ah,ah,very low per capita income up here.Not the kind of advantaged communities where you would expect a lot of students to excel.

**spk_0:** [34:43.97 - 34:53.94] Well,that's a very interesting point because we're told all the time when we complain about illiteracy,uh,oh,you just don't understand how many poor and disadvantaged people we have.

**spk_7:** [34:54.87 - 35:18.84] Nonsense.Ah,that has absolutely nothing to do with a person's ability to learn.It may affect their opportunity to learn,but certainly not their ability.The ability is native in the human condition anywhere you go.I don't care whether it's Franconia,New Hampshire,or,ah,ah,Los Angeles or,ah,the middle of,ah,China.Ah,people are the same everywhere in their ability to learn.

**spk_0:** [35:19.20 - 35:24.30] And you think if you just give them a good system in the first grade,they can learn when somebody teaches them.

**spk_7:** [35:24.75 - 35:59.99] Certainly,we did this in kindergarten.We started long before the 1st grade,and my kindergarten children,after about 6 months with our intensive phonics program,were able to decode just about any word you could put in front of them in a newspaper.They didn't necessarily understand what they were reading.Comprehension is a higher order skill.It needs a lot of work and takes time.We're talking about two separate things,but you cannot put the cart before the horse.You have to inculcate the skills to be able to.To decode words,you have to understand the sound symbol code built into our alphabet.

**spk_0:** [36:00.50 - 36:28.38] Well,uh,on that point that they may not be able to comprehend it,don't you think that once the first grader sounds it out,he has a very large oral vocabulary already,and once he sounds it out,he knows what it is.For example,a child would know what an airplane is or a helicopter or a grasshopper or whatever,and once he sounds it out,he does.Comprehend because that those words are in his oral vocabulary.Oh,

**spk_7:** [36:28.44 - 37:22.13] it goes much further than that.Ah,studies have shown that children enter kindergarten at about age 60 months or 5 years of age with a what I call a lexical load of approximately 3500 words in their speaking vocabulary and another 10,000 words or so in an understanding vocabulary.So a child comes to school equipped,knowing.About 13 to 14,000 words of his native language.Ah,it's rather foolish to put a reading,ah,primer in front of a child from a basal system that is going to introduce that child to only 150 to 200 words in the first year.You're denying the fact that the youngster really knows his language.Kids are approximately 90% language form by age 5 or 6.The schools are only going to gloss the additional 10% during the next 12 years of their public education.

**spk_0:** [37:22.87 - 37:37.44] And those basal readers that are so common in the schools only add a couple of 100 words each year so that say by the end of the 3rd or 4th grade,the child has only been taught to read what,500 words

**spk_7:** [37:37.62 - 37:55.56] approximately and whatever.They're lucky enough to pick up at home if their parents are good readers and read to them or have a lot of other literature around.In effect,a child learns a lot more out of school about reading if they're in a bad basal reading program than they will in school and at an unbelievably high cost.

**spk_0:** [37:56.10 - 38:08.03] But you do believe in in drilling the little child in the systematic phonic system so that he gets those tools in hand and then he can move right along once he has that skill.

**spk_7:** [38:08.38 - 38:45.76] Certainly that's,that's vital,and the amount of drill is not onerous and it is not a painful kind of situation for children.A lot of people have the view that when children are learning their phonics code.They're going through all kinds of rote activities.Ah,it is not mindless rote.It is drill,if it's done properly with a strong view toward effective outcomes.The children have to be given,uh,an opportunity to show that,gee,this works for me.I can now read.I can now do what big people can do.The interior motivation that children get from this is phenomenal.Adults can't understand it.

**spk_0:** [38:46.00 - 38:54.48] Oh,I,I agree,it's so exciting.It's like,look,Mom,no hands when he's riding the bicycle.It's exciting to learn how to read.

**spk_7:** [38:54.84 - 39:10.88] Certainly it is.It's exciting.It's stimulating,and it just opens up all the other doors for children,academically.They could be in control of their learning for the first time in their lives once they unlock that key to language.

**spk_0:** [39:11.41 - 39:36.01] Well,thank you very much as a former principal for sharing this experience with us and telling us uh with confidence that any child can learn how to read if he is simply taught.I found teaching the first grade the most exciting part of learning because the child has the eagerness,the energy,and the enthusiasm.We're going to have to take a break for an announcement.We thank you for calling.And what

**spk_1:** [39:36.01 - 40:35.86] about you at home?Have you had a problem with illiteracy?You know,Phyllis,I'm enjoying hearing from all the teachers this morning and this afternoon,depending on what part of the United States you're in.And if you'd like to join in on this conversation,we'll pick up the tab for the telephone call.We're at.1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.Incidentally,we've added some more lines due to the tremendous response over past weeks.So let's hear from you.Oh,and by the way,we do have a cassette copy of this program.A lot of parents like to put it to some practical use,and a lot of.Teachers do in their schools.If you do write us,we'll send it out to you for $5.Our address is Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.And by the way,that packet,that illiteracy packet is available at that same address for $10 via satellites on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_1:** [42:38.38 - 42:49.30] Illiteacy is the matter at hand this week on Phyllis-Schlafly Live via satellites on the USA Radio network.And let's move on to some more telephone calls to San Francisco.And here's Marshall,

**spk_0:** [42:49.37 - 42:55.68] Phyllis.Hello,Marshall.Are you interested in this subject of how to read and whether people are illiterate?

**spk_2:** [42:56.06 - 43:00.18] I'm very interested.I can't stand to see America going down a rat hole of illiteracy.

**spk_0:** [43:00.62 - 43:05.42] Are you shocked by the millions of people who are illiterate who've been through the public schools?

**spk_2:** [43:05.74 - 43:09.01] There's no reason for it.No reason for any of it.

**spk_0:** [43:09.75 - 43:12.53] Well,they tell us the solution is to spend more money.

**spk_2:** [43:13.47 - 43:45.68] No,there's money has absolutely nothing to do with it.You teach our kids how to read the first time.You teach them so that they know the code of the English language,the rock solid foundation basics that Charles was just talking about.You have to teach them that and once you teach them that,then they'll read.And I,you know,I have a standard of excellence that all children should be able to read.Spell and understand every word in the Declaration of Independence by the end of the 2nd grade or they do not go on to the 3rd grade.Oh,

**spk_0:** [43:45.69 - 43:46.45] that's a good test.

**spk_2:** [43:47.31 - 44:00.81] That's a test and you know I taught,I got into this whole thing because I taught my child when he was 4 years old how to read.He was reading the newspaper by the time he was 5.Well,good for you parent.So I do have a message for the parents out there.

**spk_0:** [44:00.97 - 44:06.46] And,and you were not in the teaching establishment.You're just an ordinary parent,huh?

**spk_2:** [44:06.61 - 44:30.01] I'm an ordinary parent.I didn't even know about this business of phonics,but I sat down one day after hearing about all this literacy nonsense and I said to my kid,I'm gonna teach you how to read.He said,OK,you know,a 4 year old,what does he know?So it took me about 1 year and 15 hour a day,and the kid was reading the newspaper.He could read the Declaration of Independence before he got into kindergarten.

**spk_0:** [44:30.29 - 44:30.60] Oh,

**spk_2:** [44:30.61 - 44:44.50] wonderful.And you know,my message to parents out there is that the buck stops with them.And then it's up to parents to make absolutely sure that their kids read.And if the schools can't do it,they must do it.

**spk_0:** [44:45.24 - 44:46.07] Well,that's right,but

**spk_2:** [44:46.96 - 44:47.59] we're spending

**spk_0:** [44:47.59 - 44:47.73] to teach reading,

**spk_2:** [44:54.95 - 44:55.60] so it's up to them.

**spk_0:** [44:56.16 - 45:13.11] Well,the trouble is that the schools have made parents believe that the schools are the experts,the parents should stay out of it.We've had any number of parents at our advisory center who've been told by the schools,now don't interfere.You'll just mess your child up if you try to teach them.Different from the way the school is teaching it.

**spk_2:** [45:13.45 - 46:05.33] If the schools we have 2 to 30 million literate floating around.The schools have failed and,you know,stand up and say,hey,you know,here's an emperor's new clothes.Then the emperor is naked.The kids can't read.Well,and that is what the situation is today.Nobody's out there saying,hey,the educators have failed.Well,let me,uh,successful,there wouldn't be so many illiterates.There wouldn't be so many kingdoms and remedial reading courses at colleges and universities.There wouldn't be so many adult illiteracy centers.There wouldn't be messages on TV.Teach your children,teach somebody how to read.If the schools did their job to begin with,you wouldn't have any of this.Well,

**spk_0:** [46:05.89 - 46:44.94] well,we would,uh,cut out a whole,uh,bureaucracy,a whole establishment of these remedial reading people,and they'd be out of their jobs.Well,let me ask you this,Marshall,we just had an article in our paper this past week.That my senator,Senator Paul Simon,has proposed a $3 billion federal bill called a comprehensive illiteracy elimination bill,and this is going to set up a cabinet-level council to oversee literacy programs and a big bureaucracy which he thinks is going to stop the illiteracy in this country.Would you like to comment on that?Well,he doesn't.

**spk_2:** [46:45.55 - 47:12.27] The trouble is that the people in government do not have a clue as to what is going on.They listen to all the psychologists and the educators talking in many,many big words,and they sit back and,you know,the emperor's new clothes syndrome takes over.They're afraid to say,well,I don't understand you.So they know that there's a problem of illiteracy.They listen to.educators and all of a sudden they say,yeah,you're right,we have to put in another $3 billion into this deal,something that should cost nothing.

**spk_0:** [47:13.69 - 47:18.68] That's right.All you need is a good book that teaches phonics and teach the child the skills.

**spk_2:** [47:18.84 - 47:36.87] Listen,you can teach.I taught my child phonics and how to read using the cat in the hat dictionary by PD Eastman.I have nothing to do with this guy and and Richard Scarry's best book ever.I've spent,I spent about probably $40 and my kid was a thorough and perfect reader,and today he's a marvelous speller.

**spk_0:** [47:38.54 - 47:38.79] $40.Yeah,

**spk_2:** [47:38.98 - 47:47.67] don't,you don't need $3 billion to teach our children how to read.You just have to make sure that the kids read.To begin with,did you ever hear of Marva Collins school in Chicago?

**spk_0:** [47:47.76 - 47:49.21] Oh yeah,she's wonderful.OK,

**spk_2:** [47:49.35 - 48:09.91] now I visited that school twice.I sat in on that in that classroom and I saw kids in kindergarten and first grade level reading and spelling and understanding words like malignant,benign.Things like that.These kids were marvelous readers because Marva Collins teach the children the phonetic sounds of the English language.

**spk_0:** [48:10.24 - 48:15.12] And of course she works in a,you might say a disadvantaged area of Chicago.

**spk_2:** [48:16.16 - 48:16.43] disadvantage.

**spk_0:** [48:16.68 - 48:19.08] Well,she,she proves that you can,you know,

**spk_2:** [48:19.12 - 48:43.34] the educators,what they like to do is they like to call our kids learning disabled.They like to call them at risk,dyslexic,slow,disturbed.They will blame,you know,for.Because kids can't read,they will blame anybody.They will blame the children.They will blame society.They'll blame too much sugar in the diet.They'll blame the parents.They'll blame anybody.Anything but themselves and their idiotic teaching methods.Well,

**spk_0:** [48:43.42 - 49:04.58] thank you very much,Marshall.We appreciate talking to you today and telling parents that any parent can teach his child to read in Eagle-Forum.We offer a phonics training book for $10 and the teacher's workbook to go along with it is another $10.So for $20 you can teach your child.to read before he goes into school.Literally a

**spk_1:** [49:04.58 - 49:08.39] minute for Peter in Jacksonville,Florida over WXTL.

**spk_0:** [49:08.50 - 49:11.34] Oh hello,Peter.Be quick.We have a minute left.OK,

**spk_2:** [49:11.47 - 49:53.59] Phyllis,it's good to hear from you,and we'd like to take this opportunity to say welcome aboard to Jacksonville.Let me real quickly say that teaching phonics today for the children is a lot different than What I was brought up with.Now,the guy that just said about the cat in the hat,that was the wrong Arthur.That was Doctor Seuss.Ah,that put out those books,and those books are still good,and my 8 month old baby is taking interest in this,and she's 2 months ahead of her time,and I feel like if we can at least spend time with our kids letting them know that if they can't read,they can't get a good job,and you've got to learn how to read because that's the basic points of life

**spk_0:** [49:53.74 - 49:55.40] and learning is exciting.

**spk_2:** [49:55.61 - 49:55.83] Yes,

**spk_0:** [49:56.57 - 49:57.39] definitely you don't have to make.

**spk_2:** [49:58.35 - 50:08.43] But my earlier days in high school,I never did like to read,but now I found out that the more you get older,the more books you can see,the more you take interest.

**spk_0:** [50:08.91 - 50:12.30] Well,thank you very much,Peter.We're out of time.We appreciate your call.
