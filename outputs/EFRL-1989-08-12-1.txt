**spk_0:** [00:01.96 - 00:12.94] The fastest growing movement in the country today is homeschooling.On today's program,I invite you to call in and encourage other parents by telling about your homeschooling success.

**spk_1:** [00:15.16 - 01:07.80] Welcome to Philly Schlafly Live.I'm Bruce Hayes,and of course we'll be going to your telephone calls and our toll-free number from anywhere in America.Jot it down 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.You know,until the 20th century,actually,homeschooling was the principal form of education.Most of the great men of history and women,including George Washington and other founding fathers,were educated at home.Even in modern times,some of our most successful Americans received most of their early education at home,including General Douglas MacArthur and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.Now if you're a homeschooler,please do call.In at 1-800-736-3202.Even if you're not,you're thinking about it,Phyllis,of course,you could certainly lend them some of your advice.

**spk_0:** [01:08.00 - 01:39.79] I taught all my six children to read at home before entering them in the second grade,and I do recommend it to others.Homeschooling is one of the most rewarding and fulfilling things you can do for your children.Today we're going to hear first from a homeschooler who has written several books for homeschoolers based on her own experience,Mary Pride,and Mary's on the line with us from St.Louis.Hello Mary,thank you for joining us.Glad to be here.Tell us how you got started in homeschooling your children and how many children you have and how long you homeschooled them.

**spk_2:** [01:41.47 - 01:56.45] Before we even had our first child,I determined that I wasn't going to put them in the public school system because the public school system in which I was brought up was about 20 years ahead of the other public schools.It was in Massachusetts,and we had yoga in 20

**spk_0:** [01:56.45 - 01:57.36] years ahead in what

**spk_2:** [01:57.75 - 02:23.38] in the bad stuff,stuff that's just now coming out into the other public schools.We had yoga classes and gym,pornographic literature and English class.Um,my women's studies teacher introduced us to witchcraft or tried to,um,and so I was just determined.Not,not to mention the peer pressure,drugs,sex,and all the rest of it,that this is not what I wanted for a Christian education for our children.Well,

**spk_0:** [02:23.46 - 02:29.73] didn't you want your children to be accommodated to the group and become socially acceptable among their peers?

**spk_2:** [02:29.94 - 02:52.09] Well,you know,Phyllis,and you know this as much as anybody,you can be a leader or you can be a follower.I wanted my children to be leaders.So the girl who was living downstairs from us invited us to go to a homeschooling meeting.I was just delighted to discover that this movement existed and that I didn't have to go out and invent it from scratch and that it was legal and everything like that.So we just went out and started researching resources,

**spk_0:** [02:52.18 - 02:53.62] and that was in Massachusetts.No,

**spk_2:** [02:53.70 - 03:07.05] actually this was here in St.Louis and um.The more we researched,the more we found of things already available to make teaching your children at home extremely easy,that there were support groups and state groups and all the rest of it.

**spk_0:** [03:07.21 - 03:09.24] And there are plenty of teaching materials.

**spk_2:** [03:09.57 - 03:29.98] Oh,are there plenty of teaching materials?I have written two books which are nothing but reviews of resource materials for homeschooling.They're both about as,each of them is about as thick as a phone book full of everything from phonics to geography kits.To how you can get even degrees in things like um electrical wiring and just everything.

**spk_0:** [03:30.14 - 03:31.66] What's the name of the book,Mary?Well,

**spk_2:** [03:31.78 - 03:35.66] there's two of them at the moment,the new Big Book of Home Learning and the Next Book of Home Learning.

**spk_0:** [03:36.59 - 03:40.99] Well,tell us how many children you have and how many years you homeschool them.

**spk_2:** [03:41.83 - 03:53.60] I have 6 children.We're expecting our 7th,and,um,the homeschooling,of course,begins at birth,but really I'd say we've been homeschooling tech in a technical type of sense for 6 or 7 years now.

**spk_0:** [03:53.71 - 03:54.66] You mean all of them?

**spk_2:** [03:54.91 - 03:55.39] That's right.

**spk_0:** [03:55.51 - 03:57.02] And how old is your oldest now?

**spk_2:** [03:57.43 - 03:58.27] Almost 10.

**spk_0:** [03:59.15 - 04:04.99] Well,isn't that difficult with all the children at different grade levels,uh,in,in your home?

**spk_2:** [04:05.35 - 04:34.43] Well,I don't want to sound like I'm here just plugging my books,but I wrote a book on that subject too called Schoolproof.There are various,if,if you start to understand teaching methodology,how to teach.And there are various tricks for saving yourself time.You have the older children teach the younger.You can teach two children who are closer in age the same sort of thing together.There are non-age graded subjects like social studies.There's no reason why you can't read a social studies book out loud,and even the children who can't read yet can follow along with you.

**spk_0:** [04:34.73 - 04:39.99] Do you have,uh,desks that they sit at in a,in a room that is set up like a classroom?

**spk_2:** [04:40.29 - 04:48.21] Some homeschool schoolers do that.In our case,it's mainly kitchen table and living room stuff.Not to mention all the time they spend playing with their computer.

**spk_0:** [04:49.37 - 04:57.08] And I suppose you found out,as many homeschoolers do,that you can do in about 2 hours a day,what it takes them all day in the public school.

**spk_2:** [04:58.03 - 05:08.33] I,I would go further than that.I would say we cover more,um,the actual,if you look into it,back before Dewey and his friends,the progressive educators came along,

**spk_0:** [05:08.43 - 05:13.95] you're talking about John Dewey,Dewey,who had such a tremendous effect on education in this country,

**spk_2:** [05:14.07 - 05:59.08] tremendous negative effect.Before people like him came along,children would go to school for like 36 week sessions in the year.They might go to school for like 6 years at the most,and at the end of that time they had beautiful handwriting.They could spell perfectly.They could read anything,including the Federalist Papers or the Encyclopedia Britannica and all the rest of it.They could cipher.They could do.Much more difficult algebra geometry work than our kids today can do.The problem is that the curriculum has become super saturated with all kinds of inessential and negative and distressing things,and that time-tested methods of teaching such as phonics have been thrown out.Well,if you at home,you know,zero in on the stuff that the children really need to learn,it will not take you that much time to teach them.

**spk_0:** [05:59.92 - 06:10.38] What do you think,uh,in hours a day or,or weeks out of the year,you think you can do in a 1 hour or 2 hours a day,5 days a week,what they spend all day in school doing?

**spk_2:** [06:11.52 - 06:35.66] Actually,teaching at home,I don't really even think in these terms because our kids are learning something all the time,even when I'm not sitting there teaching them because of the kinds of books and materials and games and things we have surrounding them,they're able to teach themselves even when I'm not involved in it.So on the one hand,I could say,well,they're learning 8 hours a day,but then the amount of time spending with them might be only on the nature of the 2 hours that you talked about.

**spk_0:** [06:36.10 - 06:48.65] Now you live in Missouri,I believe,and do you have any problem with the authorities?Do you have any laws that or or people who are coming around telling you that you are violating the truancy laws?

**spk_2:** [06:48.98 - 07:31.05] No.Well,Missouri actually has the best homeschooling law in the nation where you just keep basic records of what you are doing.You know,the state is not allowed to prescribe what you will be teaching other than it must include,you know,the core curriculum of reading,writing,that sort of thing.Um,you just write down how many hours a day you spend on each of these areas.And the Child,Children and Family Services people are specifically forbidden to bother you,which has been a problem in some states if the only charge against you is educational neglect,and that's,in other words,when the neighbors gets upset about it.We have not found our neighbors getting at all upset about it.There's a very good climate here.We're teaching our children at home,and quite a few people are doing it.

**spk_0:** [07:31.54 - 07:54.78] Well,I must tell you that uh we have had some calls at our parents advisory center about neighbors who were busybodies and who were very threatening to some young mothers who were trying to homeschool their children.They told them they were doing something wrong and they might.Turn them in to the authorities,but you think Missouri is a,is a good place for homeschoolers,and it's a generally a good climate.Well,

**spk_2:** [07:54.83 - 08:11.39] it's good.What's good in those cases is to have a copy of your state law on hand to show people like that.You say,look at this state law SPQ,whatever subsection FPW,you know,it says right here,here are the provisions for homeschooling in the state.You see,it's not illegal.Many people are doing it,you know.

**spk_0:** [08:12.05 - 08:17.20] Well,uh,your oldest child,what grade level would you say your oldest child is now?

**spk_2:** [08:17.41 - 08:29.81] Well,again,with homeschool children,they're in different grade levels for different subjects.I'd say Teddy is around 5th grade in language arts,but he's doing algebra and geometry,which is junior high work in mathematics.

**spk_0:** [08:30.63 - 08:39.33] Have you,have you done anything to compare the achievement of your children with what their comparable age group does in the public schools?

**spk_2:** [08:39.46 - 08:43.34] Oh yes,we give them a standardized test every year,the Iowa test of basic.

**spk_0:** [08:43.57 - 08:44.44] Where do you get that?

**spk_2:** [08:45.08 - 08:55.10] In our case,we ordered it from Bob Jones University.Their address and telephone number and all that is listed in my books.They're very friendly,helpful people to deal with,and they can send you out these tests,

**spk_0:** [08:55.33 - 08:59.07] but they didn't create the test,did they,Mary?It's just a standardized test used by everybody,

**spk_2:** [08:59.08 - 09:06.00] the exact same standardized test that they would be taking in the public schools,and you can compare them this way directly to the general school population.

**spk_0:** [09:07.88 - 09:27.55] Well,the,the whole thought of not putting children in school and of undertaking to home school them is very intimidating to a lot of young women.They think they can't do it.They don't have a college degree.They don't have a teacher certificate.What would you say to the young mother who's thinking about it,but.is timid about trying it.

**spk_2:** [09:27.95 - 09:42.75] First thing I'd suggest that she do is get a hold of her local homeschool support group and attend one or two of their meetings.There she will find a lot of these questions and concerns answered.She'll be able to talk to people who felt exactly the same way as she did a couple of years ago,but who now feel like old pros and will reassure her.

**spk_0:** [09:44.35 - 09:58.73] Uh,tell me one other thing.When you keep the children,uh,in a lesson plan around the kitchen table,uh,how long do you keep them at one time?You don't keep them there for two hours at a stretch,do you?You would have uh shorter periods of time.

**spk_2:** [09:59.58 - 10:26.33] The older ones can work on a given project for a very long period of time.They all have a very good attention span.Um,when we're doing something with all the children together at once,you're right,I don't spend two hours reading history to them all at once.However,um,someone of Teddy's age or Joseph's age or older children could sit there working on a writing project or a drawing project or a construction project or something like that or reading in a textbook for an hour or so at a time.

**spk_0:** [10:26.57 - 10:38.17] But when they're starting out,uh,at,uh,when they're starting out with a phonics program teaching them how to read,I,I found it personally.Uh,most efficient to do it at 20 minute segments.

**spk_2:** [10:38.27 - 11:10.69] That's right,10 to 20 for,for a young child,you're not looking at,you're not trying to lift the world on your shoulders here.You're just trying to give them a couple of short little lessons,get in,get out.For the very young children,I often recommend that people start off with the Calvert kindergarten program,which is really a preschool program.It doesn't get into phonics,but it gets you into the swing of teaching them.It's really fun.The children love it.And not only that,but there's a built-in bonus to this program that once you follow the teacher's manual all the way through,you will feel like you know how to teach.They show you how to approach different problems and how to deal with.

**spk_0:** [11:11.03 - 11:14.23] You mean it's got some teacher's instructions that you can tell you exactly how

**spk_2:** [11:14.23 - 11:19.39] to present everything,and you will really have a good feeling for the flow of teaching after you've done that.

**spk_0:** [11:19.98 - 11:30.66] Well Mary,thank you for giving us this encouragement,and we'll have information about the availability of your book in our packet on homeschooling,which will be available to people who write in.Thank you so much for joining us today,

**spk_1:** [11:31.07 - 11:33.73] Phyllis.Let's move on to your second guest.What do you say,

**spk_0:** [11:33.98 - 12:12.51] we have,uh,Helen Jackson.Uh,who was on the line from Petersburg,Tennessee.Helen,are you there?Yes,I'm here.Uh,well,Helen was the national full-time homemaker of the Year last year.She had a very interesting career.Helen was,was,uh,is a physicist,I believe,and she was on track to become the first black female astronaut.In the space program of NASA,and she found that taking care of her children and homeschooling them was a more fulfilling and important role.Is that right?Did I state that right,Helen?Well,tell us about your experience with homeschooling.How many children do you have?

**spk_3:** [12:12.83 - 12:13.67] I have 5.

**spk_0:** [12:13.87 - 12:16.06] You have 5,and are you homeschooling them all?

**spk_3:** [12:16.30 - 12:24.74] Uh,yes,I'm,I'm homeschooling.Three of them now.The other two are in college now.I've graduated from my home school.Oh,

**spk_0:** [12:24.82 - 12:27.30] did they go directly from homeschooling into college

**spk_3:** [12:27.30 - 12:28.67] directly,yeah,at,

**spk_0:** [12:28.70 - 12:30.68] at age,uh,what,1617,

**spk_3:** [12:30.98 - 12:38.49] the one last year,finished at 16,and I have a daughter that's been in 2 years and she finished at 16.

**spk_0:** [12:38.70 - 12:44.22] Oh,what colleges did they go to?In,in that,uh,in Tennessee,no,one,

**spk_3:** [12:45.22 - 12:50.74] my daughter went to a Christian college in Michigan and my son went to a Christian college in Alabama.

**spk_0:** [12:51.40 - 13:00.80] Well,that's wonderful.Congratulations.And they did they take entrance examinations or did they take the the SATs and all those and they all passed them and got admitted.

**spk_3:** [13:00.85 - 13:50.07] My daughter did outstanding.Let's see,uh,she's,um,right now she's,uh,upper 5%.Uh,I got,I've been,I keep getting these letters about her nationwide,and she's a National Honor Society.My son did very well also.My,my third child is entering college this this fall.In fact,he registers next week.He's 15,but he'll be 16 soon.I wasn't prepared for this.I did not know when I started a few years ago that they would be finishing this soon and ready to go to college.That was just,um,I just didn't know it was going to happen this way,um,but I find that this is what,uh,happens with a lot of the home schoolers.Their kids are just finished and ready.And when I say finished,I mean they've done chemistry and physic.advanced math and all of this stuff

**spk_0:** [13:51.25 - 14:24.80] and you taught them all those things yourself.Oh,that's just wonderful,Helen.Uh,we're gonna have to break for an announcement,but if you will stand by,we'd like to hear a little bit more about your younger children after that.It's very exciting to hear somebody who has spent years homeschooling and then entered her children right directly into college.That's a tremendous encouragement to others who think they might not be able to do it and.that's very exciting,doesn't it give you a tremendous feeling of achievement?I guess so.All right,well,stand by.We'll be back to you after the announcement.Phyllis.

**spk_1:** [14:25.48 - 14:34.83] We heard that Helen's kids stayed with her up until they went into college.Generally,what age do the children stay in the homeschooling program till?

**spk_0:** [14:35.01 - 14:46.22] Well,I think it varies.If you ask me.I homeschooled my children only at the age of 6 and after the first grade,and then I entered them in the second.Grade.So you can do whatever you want to do.Well,

**spk_1:** [14:46.27 - 15:11.01] let's talk more about homeschooling,and we certainly invite your participation in the program.Agree or disagree with anything we're talking about regarding homeschooling,we do invite your telephone calls.We're at 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202 on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [17:31.85 - 17:53.55] Yes,and Helen Jackson of Petersburg,Tennessee was telling us before the break how she has two children whom she homeschooled who are already in college,entered right into college,and another one going this year,and I think two more at home.Tell us,Helen,did you have any difficulty with the state people coming around telling them you were not doing the right thing and homeschooling your children?Well,

**spk_3:** [17:53.79 - 18:47.81] yes,I have had trouble over the years and I've lived in different states.I've lived in Texas.I lived in Pennsylvania and now I am in Tennessee.Now,in Tennessee,I,I was reported here also,I'm nosy neighbors and I didn't expect it as far back in the country as I was,but Tennessee,the laws are pretty good,um,and the social worker was just delighted.And,um,and,and,uh,was very supportive of me.However,in Pennsylvania at the time that I was in Pennsylvania,it was not well accepted at all.It was up to the discretion of the individual school district and superintendent,and,um,uh,we were,um,run out of Pennsylvania becau uh I believe basically because of our staying on,on home schooling and the,and also the lobbying work I was doing on behalf of that.Uh,they,they have been very hostile.

**spk_0:** [18:48.09 - 18:51.71] Now who is they,Helen?Who is they who were hostile?

**spk_3:** [18:52.12 - 19:24.64] The,um,this was,um.Not actually the school district.This was child social services,and many of whom are child welfare,whoever it is,and they consider the Christian family as a fanatic threat,you know,to the child,and based on that,they will drum up charges out of midair that can get where they can get custody of the children from you.And even put you in jail and uh and and with that kind of threat we had to leave Pennsylvania.

**spk_0:** [19:24.92 - 19:30.05] Oh,that's terrible.And that's when you went to Tennessee.You're,you're a little bit out of Huntsville,is that right?

**spk_3:** [19:30.20 - 20:10.67] Yeah,at Huntsville,it's not.We were in Huntsville also where we were threatened there.We were only there a few weeks.Uh,a few months and we were planning to,to move to Tennessee anyway and build our home there,but they approached us in Alabama where it's not really legal.You have to have a very tight cover in Alabama to do it and they,they.Approached on a Friday and we were gone Saturday because they were going to be back Monday,uh,and you know,uh,demanding that our children be,you know,put in public school,which I was not,you know,I gave up my career and,and I made my stand,you know.Uh,that that was not what I was going to do.

**spk_0:** [20:10.99 - 20:24.43] Well,Helen,you're a very courageous woman,and we congratulate you for locating yourself where you could give your children the best education,homeschooling,and you're a real inspiration to other people.We'll move along now and take the next.

**spk_1:** [20:24.65 - 20:32.13] Call.Well,let's certainly do.Calls from across America.A couple lined up first from Texas.Phyllis,and let's go out to Odessa and here's Cheryl.

**spk_0:** [20:32.46 - 21:58.53] Hello,Cheryl,what is your question or comment on this subject?Hello,Phyllis.I just wanted to mention that I am brand new in this homeschooling.Uh,we have not even received our actual,actual curriculum books yet,but we did register our daughter who is 7 1/2 through an umbrella school.Which will take care of your grading,uh,your testing,your issuing of the report cards at regular intervals,um,which the school authorities accept a whole lot easier out here than just taking your children.Out of public school and looking like you've just completely gone off the deep end with them.Maybe you better tell us what an umbrella school is.OK,this is just a private Christian school,uh,Christian Liberty Academy is who we chose to go through.And where are they located?They're located in,uh,Arlington Heights,Illinois.And they give you a grading system so that you can tell the authorities you're going through all of this paperwork,is that it?Pardon me,uh,they,they have a grading system,is that it?Uh,and,and we'll give you reports on your children,is that what they do right now what they've done already,what we have completed is they sent a regular California achievement test and I administered it to my daughter exactly the way they suggested and sent it back for their grading.They will choose her curriculum according to her own personal needs according to these test results,and then they will,uh,

**spk_2:** [21:58.71 - 22:06.27] as you finish a unit of teaching with the child,you send the test back to them.They will grade it,send you the,the test

**spk_0:** [22:06.27 - 22:06.81] results,

**spk_2:** [22:07.15 - 22:13.71] and at regular intervals just like a public school,they will send a certified,uh,report card.

**spk_0:** [22:14.59 - 23:20.93] And do you have a local support group to meet with?Do you know other mothers I did want to address too.Mary Pride was suggesting that people who are interested get with a local support group,and that is a hard thing to do because like here where I am,we are just now building a support group.Well,it is very valuable to be able to talk to other people who are doing the same thing you're doing.When I was homeschooling my children and teaching them how to read,I did not know one other living human being who was doing that.And I had some friends who heard about it and told me I was doing a dreadful thing.But I was convinced it was the right thing and it was,but it's must be convinced it makes it much better if you,if you have other people you can exchange ideas with and support each other.So I hope you will build a support group and I'll bet you they're out there in your town even though you haven't found them.Uh,I find that a lot of homeschoolers don't want to be on anybody's list,but they're probably there.So thank you very much Cheryl for calling in.We appreciate your call.

**spk_1:** [23:21.22 - 23:23.93] Lubbock,Texas,and Tim for Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [23:24.07 - 23:27.15] Hello Tim,what is your question or comment?Well,hi Phyllis.

**spk_6:** [23:27.35 - 23:37.54] It's good talking to you.I just wanted to share with you some of the legal battles we've had in Texas.And uh I'm a member of the Texas Homeschool Coalition.

**spk_0:** [23:37.98 - 23:43.72] Well,please tell us about your legal battles.We want to know what homeschooling parents can do and cannot do.

**spk_6:** [23:43.90 - 24:13.72] Well,we've had a good situation in Texas.Um,in Texas,private schools are not regulated and the state education code says that you,uh,we have an exemption from the compulsory attendance law if you're in a private school.In the early 80s,we had quite a problem with that because the It was some,uh,discrepancy or disagreement over what constituted a private school.And consequently if you,uh,lived in certain school districts you got prosecuted and others you didn't.

**spk_0:** [24:14.04 - 24:15.52] You mean really prosecuted?

**spk_6:** [24:16.08 - 24:22.74] Yes,taken to court and,uh,for violating the compulsory attendance law we had a,

**spk_0:** [24:23.53 - 24:24.88] and so didn't you have a test case?

**spk_6:** [24:25.28 - 24:51.77] Yes,in,uh,1984,the,uh,an attorney with the Rutherford Institute brought a class action suit,uh,on behalf of the homeschoolers in Texas against all public schools in Texas.And ask the courts for a declaratory judgment.Um Before that came to court,the,uh,state board of Education tried to,uh,deal with that issue,and we had about 4000 people show up in Austin for a public hearing.

**spk_0:** [24:51.97 - 24:57.42] Now,that's what I was going to ask you about.I,I remember reading about some enormous demonstrations.Yes,

**spk_6:** [24:57.50 - 25:18.04] we call that in Texas the,uh,we have the TEA,which is the Texas Education Agency,and we call that little gathering the Austin Tea Party,and they made quite an impact in the,uh,There were 10 to 15 state legislators there who testified before the committee that the state board did not have legal authority to deal with private education.

**spk_0:** [25:18.58 - 25:33.47] Well,the National Education Association,and of which the TEA,the Texas Education Association,is a branch,is certainly adamantly opposed to the whole idea of homeschooling.Um,did they really fought too hard,did they?Oh yes,

**spk_6:** [25:33.55 - 25:56.61] they did,and this was all,uh,uh,from what I heard,this was a result of the attorney general's,he,uh,negotiated for a year and a half to try to get us to drop our suit,and when he couldn't,he tried to come in the back door through the regulation.Uh,but nevertheless,all that fell through and in September of '87,uh,a state district judge ruled that in Texas home schools are indeed private schools.

**spk_0:** [25:56.90 - 26:04.42] That is if,if one parent teaches one child in his own home,that is a private school.That's correct.Do you have to be registered anywhere?

**spk_6:** [26:04.58 - 26:23.65] No,ma'am.Uh,this was,uh,the,the judge said that,uh,all you had to do is you had to have a bona fide situation,in other words,where there's not a sham going on,but true education.And you just had to have a curriculum that covers the basic areas of reading,spelling,math,and of course some good citizenship,

**spk_0:** [26:24.25 - 26:28.05] and you don't have to do anything unless they come around and ask you what you're doing,is that it?

**spk_6:** [26:28.41 - 26:45.61] And if they come to the door,uh.We encourage our people because there's been some,uh,since that case more subtle harassment,uh,we encourage our people to just be polite and ask them to submit whatever they want to us in writing,and we'll be glad to respond and many times it just ends right there.Well,

**spk_0:** [26:45.69 - 26:46.93] you don't have to let them in your door,

**spk_6:** [26:47.05 - 26:54.13] do you?Oh no,oh no.In fact,we encourage people not to do that.Just be polite.But make them accountable,make them document everything they do.

**spk_0:** [26:54.51 - 26:56.47] Well,are you homeschooling your own children?

**spk_6:** [26:56.87 - 27:00.43] Yes,I am.We have 4 children.We've been homeschooling for about 5 years,

**spk_0:** [27:00.59 - 27:05.21] and they haven't been in public schools at all.And what's the top grade level you're dealing with now?

**spk_6:** [27:05.38 - 27:08.72] Well,our oldest is almost 13.He'll be in the 7th grade this next year.

**spk_0:** [27:08.83 - 27:11.23] Are you going to keep it up and enter him right into college?

**spk_6:** [27:11.41 - 27:13.42] I think so.That's our plan at this point.

**spk_0:** [27:14.35 - 27:24.73] Well,isn't it a little frightening when you get into some of those science courses and at the high school level?Do you,uh,A,a lot of parents feel unable to deal with that.

**spk_6:** [27:25.09 - 27:45.56] Well,I think that goes back to what you were talking with your previous caller about a support group.We have a strong support group here and we have some doctors and things like that who we do co op programs with.So if somebody wants to teach a biology class or a chemistry class or something like that,we can.Co op and do that a few days a week and cover some of those areas that maybe a a parent can't deal with

**spk_0:** [27:45.86 - 27:51.18] and you also have uh cooperative programs for various types of athletics,don't you?Oh yes,

**spk_6:** [27:51.26 - 28:05.86] we have,uh,some soccer programs and really the great thing we have,uh,since we won this class action suit our support group here has doubled in size and so really whatever a group wants,if there's enough people that want to do it,we just get together and,and work it out and do it.

**spk_0:** [28:06.53 - 28:28.45] Well thank you very much Tim.That's very encouraging.I remember seeing the picture of those 4000 people.It was very exciting and that sends a message to all the public officials that is uh probably was probably and was more powerful than the message that the National Education Association was trying to send.So good luck in what you're doing.Uh,congratulations.On the inspiration you've given to others.

**spk_1:** [28:28.61 - 29:06.66] We're talking about homeschooling this week on Phyllis-Schlafly Live,of course,welcoming your telephone calls.Whether you agree or disagree,we'd like to hear from you at 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.Some lines open,some people lined up.To talk to you,Phyllis.And of course if you do try in and the number's busy,well,we certainly invite you to try back again.A quick reminder that a cassette copy of this program is available to you.Just send us $5 we'll mail it out to you.Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.We'll be back on Philly Schlafly Live.

**spk_4:** [29:09.86 - 30:08.46] Eagle-Forum has been leading the pro-family movement to victory since 1972.Eagle-Forum has achieved an unmatched record of success,stopping the anti-family Equal Rights Amendment,preserving women's exemption from the military draft in combat duty,working for federal and state legislation to eliminate child pornography.That's proof that citizen volunteers can determine government policies in Congress and in state legislatures,but the fight continues.Eagle-Forum is now working for a tax credit for every child,for parents and pupils' rights and education,for economic growth through lower taxes,for a strong national defense.And for private enterprise,join us,the men and women of Eagle-Forum who share conservative pro-family values with a faith in God,in America,and with hope for the future based on freedom and opportunity for all.Wright Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [30:15.67 - 30:37.65] On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and every week we like to get together of an hour with you.And this week we're talking about homeschooling.Phyllis,we've heard from different parts of the country.Uh,they have different obstacles to overcome if they're thinking about homeschooling.Uh,when should parents start?considering homeschooling at what age?

**spk_0:** [30:37.78 - 30:57.56] Of course we believe that you start learning from birth,but as far as formal homeschooling,I would really start it at 6.That's the age that I recommend.People may have other views.Dr.Raymond Moore,whom we hope to have on this program sometime,thinks you could start a little later.But people have different experiences.Let's hear from them.And let's

**spk_1:** [30:57.56 - 31:04.84] go to 1-800-736-3202.Carol in Indianapolis,Indiana over WXIR.

**spk_0:** [31:05.16 - 31:08.34] Hello,Carol.Hello Carol,are you there?

**spk_1:** [31:10.82 - 31:16.20] The little child's on the phone saying,Mom,come to the phone.They're there.Carol,are you there?

**spk_0:** [31:17.47 - 31:20.03] Hi,hello,hello,Carol.What is your question or comment?

**spk_5:** [31:21.23 - 31:37.24] Um,I'm a single parent and I would love to be able to be involved in the homeschooling.But I don't know how to do that and make a living and support my children.Plus,I live in Indiana and I don't know what the laws are regulating homeschooling here.

**spk_0:** [31:37.58 - 32:42.64] The laws in states are very different.They go all the way from Missouri,where it's easy to,as we heard earlier on the program,Pennsylvania,where it's difficult.Uh,home schooling does require one parent to be there in order to do the homeschooling,but I would say that even if you have to be employed,that you could undertake to teach your child to read.Uh,that's the most important thing you learn in schooling is how to read,and you could do that in your spare time.You could do that for a couple of sessions in the morning before you go to work and again in the afternoon.And that way you would make your make sure that your child is not handicapped and uh that your child does not become one of these functional illiterates that we hear so much about.Also,if you write for our packet on home schooling,uh,you will be able to get uh Mary Pride's big book of home learning which may give you a number of ideas for how you can very um adequately supplement whatever your child is getting in school.

**spk_1:** [32:43.43 - 32:53.22] And information packets are available for $10.All you have to do is write Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.Satisfactory on the answer?

**spk_0:** [32:53.32 - 32:55.62] Well,thank you,Carol,for calling.Good luck.

**spk_1:** [32:55.89 - 32:59.81] And we move on to Wisconsin,and here's Paula Phyllis over.You RVM.

**spk_0:** [33:00.66 - 33:04.85] Hello Paula.What is your question or comment?Well,I've been

**spk_3:** [33:05.06 - 33:06.94] homeschooling for 5 years now.

**spk_0:** [33:07.17 - 33:07.98] How many children?

**spk_3:** [33:08.14 - 33:24.66] 14-year-old boy,a 17-year-old boy,so he'll be in high school this year,and I have a 3-year-old girl who we haven't started yet.My husband's a pastor in a small church up here and most of our um people do homeschool,although there are different um forms of curriculum.

**spk_0:** [33:25.18 - 33:28.98] Well,that's wonderful then you're not the oddball.You're,you're one of the group.No,

**spk_3:** [33:29.04 - 33:46.73] in fact,we've had a few people come into the church just because we were favorable to homeschooling and we have a support group and um there are different curriculums.We're using ACE and there are people using Raymond Moore's.Where they mostly have to do it themselves.

**spk_0:** [33:47.01 - 34:11.45] So you found that there are,there is quite a variety of different materials you can get.Yes.And are you happy with your homeschooling results?Yes.Uh,how do you answer this question,uh,that is sometimes asked?Um,don't you want your children to be socialized with the other children in the schools?Don't you want them to interact with their peers and their age group in the public schools?

**spk_3:** [34:11.79 - 34:56.67] Well,not in our public schools.Uh,we've had um We have several children the same age so they get together for church activities.So that's,that's something everybody forgets,you know,forget church,you know,that's not a place where you can go to interact with,with other kids,but we believe it is and it's the best place and uh.Let's see,also we,we do the CAT test every year and the California Achievements,so it there,then again you can,you know,see where your kids stack up against the other kids.Also,um,there are.Some kids the same age that have gotten into so much trouble,you don't want them to be with them.And yes,

**spk_0:** [34:56.75 - 35:11.29] well,one answer I give is no,you don't want your children to be socialized with those other little savages who are saying bad words and doing bad things.Well,thank you very much,Paula,for giving us this encouragement.I hope your experience will inspire others to do the same thing.

**spk_1:** [35:11.45 - 35:18.44] Phyllis,your children are all grown now.What was the biggest obstacle,or did you have an obstacle when you were homeschooling your children?

**spk_0:** [35:18.81 - 35:43.84] I didn't have any support group.I didn't know one other person in this world who did it.I didn't consider that an obstacle though,because I never felt the need to rely on other people.But I can see that many people do find that need,and it's out there now,and I'm very happy it's out there now.In Illinois,where we lived,the compulsory school age was 7.And I taught my children to read before the age of 7.

**spk_1:** [35:43.96 - 35:56.09] 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202 from anywhere in America.O KSIV,our flagship station in St.Louis.Here's Vicky.

**spk_0:** [35:56.23 - 35:58.89] Hello Vicky,what is your question or comment?Hi,

**spk_3:** [35:59.01 - 36:08.61] I'd like to get some information on how to teach my kids at home.My husband and I both want to teach them.We don't want to put them through the public schools anymore.

**spk_0:** [36:09.35 - 38:14.17] Uh,one thing I would suggest is to get Mary Pride's book on,uh,it's a big book on home learning,and it gives you a list of all sorts of available materials.It does not recommend any.It is not a book that advises you which ones to use.Uh,now in Eagle-Forum we have a strictly phonics program for teaching children to read,and I do recommend that.I think it is the best phonics program available,and I think that's the most important thing that you need to teach your children so that they are good readers so then the whole world is open to them of history and government and science and literature.Uh,the other thing you can do is try to contact one of the support groups in your area,and I don't have information on that to recommend,but if you call our office,you could probably,uh,we could probably direct you to somebody in the area.I know homeschooling is good for people in Missouri.As a matter of fact,the homeschooling group is so effective in Missouri that they got the governor to officially proclaim homeschooling Week.And this year,the governor of Missouri issued a proclamation that said,whereas the people of Missouri are committed to.Excellence in education and whereas Missourians recognize the importance of family participation and educational freedom in pursuit of that excellence and whereas home education is a means used by many families to prepare Missouri's young people to face the challenges of the 21st century.Now therefore,I,John Ashcroft,governor,do proclaim Home Education Week,and they had a big,uh,celebration and demonstrations and a lot of them went to the Capitol and they,uh,they gave some home baked bread to the legislators and they introduced a lot of state representatives to the fact that they have homeschoolers in their districts.So I think you would find a lot of support out there if you,uh,if you try it and if you contact people

**spk_1:** [38:14.55 - 38:19.47] on the Green Bay,Wisconsin over at WRVM and it's Sue for Philly Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [38:19.55 - 38:22.78] Hello,Sue.What is your question or comment?Well,I,

**spk_7:** [38:23.07 - 39:04.43] I have a comment,and I just want to say that our choice of homeschooling came as a very unique situation,being as how God had already called us to take in severely brain damaged children.And I was formerly used to monitoring with the children at the Christian school that we were in a,in a church Christian school.And so when we started taking in the severely retarded children for the first few years,I would,I would pack up the,the little ones along with the older ones and take them on to the Christian school,and it got to be where it just wasn't the best thing for.The little ones and you're

**spk_0:** [39:04.43 - 39:05.64] talking about your own children,

**spk_7:** [39:05.99 - 39:38.95] yes,yes,we,we adopted these,you know,two younger ones,and in the course of God's calling to continue to adopt severely retarded children,it became a real,um,frustrating situation because I wanted to be with,you know,with our,our older 4 normal children as well as the,the severely retarded ones.And God said,homeschooling,that's it.That's the answer.And it was just,it was frustrating at first because I didn't feel as though I could deal with homeschooling and meeting the needs of the younger ones as well.

**spk_0:** [39:39.25 - 39:49.05] Well,what a beautiful story,Sue.Thank you for telling us about that.We,we,we are going to have to stop for a break.If you'll hang on for a couple of minutes,I'll let you finish your sentence after that.

**spk_1:** [42:21.85 - 42:26.19] Exciting conversation this week about homeschooling on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [42:26.53 - 42:38.36] Before the break we were talking to Sue in Green Bay.Are you still there,Sue?And she was telling how her mission is to take in severely retarded children,and that's what led her into homeschooling her own.Sue,you had another comment.

**spk_7:** [42:39.29 - 43:58.35] Yes,I wanted to say that in spite of the fact That I didn't feel as though,you know,I might be qualified.However,when God calls you to do something,he doesn't let you just stand there.He gives you everything that you need.And so in our desire to be completely yielded to His will,we said yes.And he just,along with Mary Pride's book.Which was very helpful and,um,and other areas that we had checked out.Uh,our oldest one,was in 11th grade and our youngest in 6th grade and uh the,the material just flooded in.I couldn't um keep up with it fast enough as to what was available out there and uh,uh,this is 4 years later we're going into our 5th year of home schooling and our oldest is in his,uh,he's going into his 3rd year of college.He's preparing for political science.And our,our second oldest is going into college as well,and we'll have one graduating next year and 2 years after that,and God has just supplied us and we were a little um concerned,of course,about the,um the subjects of algebra and uh geometry and,and those harder subjects to deal with.However,a Becca Holm video uh was available as of.Last year and somewhat before the year before that,and that has been very,very helpful and very simple.

**spk_0:** [43:58.67 - 44:08.02] Well,congratulations,Sue,to you and to what you've accomplished,and that must be a big thrill to have a homeschooling child enter directly into college.We appreciate your call.

**spk_1:** [44:08.08 - 44:14.07] 1-800-736-3202.It's Candy in St.Louis over KSIV Phyllis.

**spk_0:** [44:14.18 - 44:16.14] Hello,Candy,what is Your comment.

**spk_3:** [44:16.44 - 44:36.32] Well,first,I want to thank you,Mrs.S Shafffly,for all you've done for families across America,and I just want to say that,um,we have wonderful support groups in St.Louis,and,uh,my husband and I are leaders of the Missouri Saint Louis North County group,and we are just really impressed with the homeschooling parents' concern and commitment.

**spk_0:** [44:36.52 - 44:38.70] How many homeschooling parents are in your group?

**spk_3:** [44:39.28 - 44:41.28] Well,we have over 300 families.

**spk_0:** [44:42.00 - 44:42.10] Oh,

**spk_3:** [44:42.17 - 44:48.43] that's had over 100 families inquire about homeschooling this last year.So it's really growing.

**spk_0:** [44:48.86 - 44:57.82] And what does your support group do?Do you,do you,uh,tell them about different materials?Do you get together and exchange,uh,problems and how you deal with them?Yes,

**spk_3:** [44:57.94 - 45:33.22] we do.Um,this,I also wanted to say August 24th,it's a Thursday evening from 7 to 9 at the First Baptist Church of Ferguson,which is 333 North Florissant.We will be having a beginning homeschooling seminar,and we have two of these each year.And what we cover in the seminar is the Missouri Law.Logging hours,plan book,curriculum,useful resources,how to teach,creative teaching,organization,and meal planning.They receive a packet at the meeting or they can call and receive a packet,and I call them up through the year to check on them to see how they're doing.Our meetings themselves,um,

**spk_0:** [45:33.96 - 45:55.16] well,well,let me say,uh,when I've addressed homeschooling meetings,I find that they're always about 3 times more people who show up as we thought knew about the meeting.They just seem to come out of the woodwork because they're.Not on anybody's list.So I'll let you give the,uh,time and place of that meeting again in case there are anybody listening to this program who would like to attend.

**spk_3:** [45:55.32 - 46:36.03] OK.The date of it is August 24th,which is a Thursday evening,and it's from 7 to 9 p.m. and it's at the First Baptist Church of Ferguson,which the address is 333 North Florissant.Now,that meets in August and then we start our regular meetings in September and we meet on the 4th Thursday of each month.Um,at our meetings,we have an,we meet with the new people at 7:00 to 7:30 each meeting.And then from 7:30 to 8:00,we have announcements,and then from 8:00 to 9,we have a speaker come in.Um,we have these meetings each month and we put out a monthly newsletter.We also have roller skating and field trips and clubs.We're starting for the,for the

**spk_0:** [46:36.03 - 46:37.15] parents or the children.

**spk_3:** [46:37.31 - 46:37.67] I'm sorry,

**spk_0:** [46:37.79 - 46:39.40] ma'am,for the parents or the children?

**spk_3:** [46:39.91 - 46:48.14] I think for both.And we have a book sale and picnic,and many of the other groups in St.Louis do these same things.And do

**spk_0:** [46:48.14 - 46:53.75] you have displays of materials of the kinds of different courses that they can buy to teach their children?

**spk_3:** [46:54.02 - 47:06.26] Yes,we do in the beginning,homeschooling meetings which meet twice a year.And then I do try to have of the most popular curriculums,I try to have catalogs available on the table each meeting.

**spk_0:** [47:06.97 - 47:23.15] Well,that's a wonderful service you provide.Um,I wish somebody call in and say why home schooling is bad we're so we could get the kind of arguments that people face when they take up homeschooling.Uh,but at any rate,um,Candy,thank you for all you're doing and your support group.We appreciate your call.

**spk_1:** [47:23.22 - 47:33.42] We've got about an estimated 3 million potential listeners in St.Louis,so that address helps us so much,at least in this town.Let's go out to,uh,Morgan in Dubique,

**spk_0:** [47:33.51 - 47:37.20] Iowa.Hello,how are you and what is your question or comment?

**spk_3:** [47:37.79 - 47:39.99] OK,um,I'm thinking about

**spk_2:** [47:39.99 - 47:40.46] homeschooling.

**spk_3:** [47:40.51 - 47:43.15] I just listened to your program and I think about homeschooling my

**spk_2:** [47:43.15 - 47:43.51] child

**spk_3:** [47:43.51 - 47:43.89] who's

**spk_2:** [47:44.15 - 48:00.10] only 5 right now.Um,and,you know,all the pressures that come with going against the norm and deciding to want to homeschool.I've been to one seminar and it kinda explained a little bit of what I'm supposed to do.But I'm wondering,you know,

**spk_3:** [48:00.26 - 48:08.98] should I be getting curriculum for a five year old or what I've been doing is I've been,um,teaching him a lot as a World Book Encyclopedia,and he,

**spk_2:** [48:09.06 - 48:16.70] I've read to him since he's young and he loves listening.And I feel like he's just soaking in so much,but there's such pressure

**spk_3:** [48:16.70 - 48:17.81] to have results,

**spk_2:** [48:18.10 - 48:19.10] to have,you know,

**spk_0:** [48:19.83 - 49:30.89] Well,my,my suggestion to you,and I love the 5 and 6 year olds,is to get Eagle Forum's phonics program and teach your child to read.I would also suggest that you take 1 year at a time.You don't need to make a commitment today that you are going to home school your child to the age of 16 when he goes into college.Just make the commitment that you're going to start and take 1 year at a time.And teach them to read and teaching a child to read is so exciting.It's the only thing I can compare it to is watching a child walk across the floor for the first time.It's so thrilling and when you go through the 20 minute session patterns of taking the child through learning the sounds and syllables of the English language.And then one day he's able to put those sounds together and and read words long words like I remember recently my the the first day my grandson was able to put together the sounds and read the word grasshopper and then once he said it he knew what it was because he knows what a grasshopper is that's exciting and.I would recommend you start like that.

**spk_9:** [49:54.92 - 50:53.69] Too many children have been cheated out of the education they deserve.Did you know that nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science?That's a problem we can no longer afford to ignore.Educational excellence in the public school starts with respect for the rights of students,parents,and taxpayers.But what are they?Every student has the right to be taught to read the English language in the first grade.Every student has the right to family privacy,the right to his religious faith and beliefs,the right to share information with his parents.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy from Eagle-Forum.Learn more about the rights you and your children should expect.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy by writing Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_0:** [51:57.15 - 52:36.54] There are many reasons today why parents are making the decision for homeschooling.Some simply don't want their children to be in the public school environment of drugs and lack of discipline.Some want their children to have a religious instead of an anti-religious education.Some parents want to attend to the special needs of a handicapped child,and for some it's simply to give their children a superior academic education to make sure they learn phonics and how to read and write the English language.Next week we'll be talking about global education,one of the trendy new types of curriculum.In the schools,please join me next week.
