**spk_0:** [00:00.59 - 00:10.35] Many people think that the National Education Association,the NEA is the most powerful special interest group in the country today.Let's talk about it.

**spk_1:** [00:13.41 - 00:59.26] Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.This week we'll discover just part of the agenda of the National Education Association.It's a major supporter of the liberal agenda.And the most powerful force in public education today,we'll hear Phyllis's thoughts on the NEA and how you can counter their liberal policies.Of course,your telephone calls take note of our toll-free number because you may very well have some opinions or a question for Phyllis.Here's our number 1-800-736-3202.1-800-736-3202.Get in now while the lines are open.I'm Bruce Hayes.Phyllis,before we move into our main focus.Are you surprised at the public uproar about the Supreme Court's decision in the American flag case?

**spk_0:** [00:59.37 - 01:07.14] I am surprised at how the court decided,but I'm not surprised at the uproar.The flag is very precious to the American people,

**spk_1:** [01:07.92 - 01:16.76] and it's another issue here that comes to mind.It's been quite agonizing,hasn't it,waiting so long for the Supreme Court's decision on this abortion case.

**spk_0:** [01:16.86 - 01:35.75] It looks like the court is having perhaps second thoughts,perhaps wrestling with indecision.It was a terrible thing the Court did in Roe versus Wade,and I'm asking everyone to be in prayer this weekend,asking God to give wisdom to the justices so they can undo their mistake of 16 years ago.

**spk_1:** [01:35.92 - 01:40.72] Now you've worked hard on the federal day care bill,and it passed the Senate last week.

**spk_0:** [01:40.96 - 02:07.83] The bill that passed the Senate is highly discriminatory toward mothers in the home.We're urging people to write their congressman and Tell them to support a bill that is fair to homemakers by giving a tax credit to every child.Any particular bill,indeed,yes,the Holloway Toddler Tax Credit Bill,HR 2008.Already 111 congressmen are co-sponsors.Call up your congressman and ask him to co-sponsor it.

**spk_1:** [02:08.19 - 02:13.01] Today's subject,the National Education Association,the NEA.

**spk_0:** [02:13.51 - 04:05.92] The National Education Association,the NEA is the most powerful force in the public schools today.NEA members virtually control the $200 billion spent every year on public schools.NEA members practically control the US Department of Education and all 50 state departments of education.Its members are the single biggest influence in the election of congressmen,state legislators,and school board members.NEA members are active in every state and community with an elaborate lobbying apparatus.The NEA is the largest teachers' union,and the dues money from its members give it a $100 million a year budget.You've heard a lot in recent weeks about the influence of political action committees on elections.Well,the most powerful special interest political group in the United States today is the NEA.It has hundreds of lobbyists in Congress and at the 50 state capitals,but that's just peanuts compared to the billions of dollars of tax monies its members control.The NEA used to be a sacred cow,but then came Secretary of Education William Bennett and his Director of Education Research Chester Finn.They started telling the truth about the NEA,the truth about how the NEA mounts elaborate publicity campaigns to persuade the people that our public schools are basically fine and that any problems could be easily solved just by giving them more tax money.The NEA savagely attacks anyone who criticizes the quality of the public schools.Doctor Finn said bluntly that the NEA has succumbed to the doctrines of the left and views the classroom as an instrument of social change where learning takes a back seat to political action.

**spk_1:** [04:06.20 - 04:19.07] Today's guest is Mrs.Janina Hanson,who's on the line from Reno.Nevada.Janine is Eagle-Forum,Nevada's state chairman and has had considerable experience observing the NEA at the Nevada state Capitol.

**spk_0:** [04:19.53 - 04:26.37] Hello,Janine.Good morning,Phyllis.Thanks for joining us today.Tell us your observations of the NEA in action in Nevada.

**spk_2:** [04:26.65 - 04:49.03] Well,I've been a volunteer lobbyist at my state legislature since the early ERA years in 1973.And I've spent considerable time down there year after year,but particularly this year,every time I was down there on a good bill that we thought would,uh,help the public schools or a bad bill trying to defeat it.There was the National Education Association,their state affiliates opposing us.

**spk_0:** [04:49.19 - 04:51.91] You mean you never found yourself on the same side as the NEA?

**spk_2:** [04:52.11 - 04:54.15] Never,never,never.

**spk_0:** [04:54.51 - 04:56.99] Well,what are some of the things that you watched them doing?Well,

**spk_2:** [04:57.05 - 05:47.01] one of the things I thought was most significant was a bill that we really hadn't sponsored or gotten too involved in,but it was one that the state legislators thought was important,and that was to require accountability in the schools.It was a,a school accreditation proposal,and they would have,uh,uh.Check the schools out by using test scores,attendance records,dropout rates,teacher performance,and other measures of accountability.Are the schools doing a good job?The NEA was,uh,vehemently opposed to any kind of accountability.They did not anyway want teachers tested.They didn't want any way to be able to say that this school is better than that school,and they just came out in an outrage against this bill.They were also there promoting,of course,mandatory kindergarten because in Nevada we don't have mandatory kindergarten and our attendance isn't until 7 years old.They don't have to be in school.

**spk_0:** [05:47.17 - 05:50.36] Well,mandatory kindergarten makes more jobs for the union,doesn't it?

**spk_2:** [05:50.50 - 06:22.29] Absolutely more jobs for the union,but it went far beyond mandatory kindergarten.It went on that they want to have preschool screening for kids and require that parents,uh,have preschool screening so that they can put them in even earlier than kindergarten.And so they were down there promoting that and of course several big bills that would have increased our taxes significantly the NEA was in favor of,and one of them happened to be on the ballot,and it,it just lost dramatically and still they kept on pushing for higher taxes.

**spk_0:** [06:22.45 - 06:34.28] Well,when you go to the state capitol as a volunteer and with your volunteer friends,what type of lobbying apparatus do you find on the other side?Is it professional?Are they tax paid?Are they salaried people?

**spk_2:** [06:34.66 - 07:05.83] Well,uh,we find a combination of things,of course.They have several NEA paid people at the state capitol at all times.They also use some of the local NEA affiliates in the different,uh,counties,and they come there.They're salaried NEA people,and they are lobbying.Then because of the NEA's incredible political clout,which is really their goal to,ah,become the foremost political power in the nation.They have elected many of the school board members on the local level as well as on the state board of education.

**spk_0:** [07:05.96 - 07:09.88] You mean they're they're directly active in politics in support of candidates.Oh,

**spk_2:** [07:10.00 - 07:40.83] that is absolutely,and I'll,I'd like to tell you a little story about that when we finish with the,the state lobbying activity.But they've also co-opted the local boards of education,the state board of education,and as you stated earlier,they've co-opted the state departments of education.And so not only is the NEA there with their own paid people,but they've got government paid people there from the state Department of Education,teachers,and others who are on government salaries.They're lobbying for them,and there we are with our little band of volunteers trying to oppose them.

**spk_0:** [07:41.07 - 08:29.47] Janine,the last time I went to Tallahassee,Florida,that's a state where you have to register to be a lobbyist.Maybe you don't.Do that in your state.We don't do it in ours,but in Florida they do,and I counted up the number of lobbyists who were registered to lobby on elementary and secondary education only,and they came to 318.Now those are representatives of the state Department of Education,of the school boards,of the,uh,Florida teachers union.And a few of them,a handful of them would be paid directly by the NEA,but all the 318,or all the rest of them were tax salary,and they,but they weren't full time at the legislature,but they were available at any time to,to lobby at the legislature,and that's what we're trying.To counteract with a handful of volunteers,

**spk_2:** [08:29.83 - 08:55.96] I think it's so important for people to get involved in their state legislatures because they can,as a volunteer,have an effect,uh,even though the NEA is so strong,the legislators have a great desire to hear the other side.The only way they heard the other side on many bills that we followed this session was because we were there.Eagle-Forum was the only group that was aware enough of the NEA agenda to be there and to be opposing it.Well,

**spk_0:** [08:56.12 - 09:01.14] tell us how you saw the NEA in action in,uh,in elections for candidates.

**spk_2:** [09:01.65 - 09:43.22] We were very concerned,uh,in the last couple of years because they passed a,a terrible sex and AIDS education bill.I mean,it's absolutely obscene and I won't go into all the details,but it's so harmful to our children going into intimate and perverted details of sex starting in the 4th grade.Uh,and so we had opposed this,and in fact we held a public meeting and over 1000 people turned out.That's the most people that have ever turned out for any hearing of any kind in the state of Nevada.There was 3 deep standing room only.They had to open up an extra room and still the local school board passed this objectionable sex and AIDS education program.Well,

**spk_0:** [09:43.31 - 09:45.30] why did they do that instead of listening to the people?

**spk_2:** [09:45.55 - 10:15.07] Well,because they were in the pocket of the NEA.The NEA had given them money when they ran for election.They had NEA teachers out walking door to door for them and provided them with great political support.In fact,the NEA has access to the schools.They can go in and hand out political literature to every teacher,and,uh,someone who is opposing that particular candidate.Doesn't have the opportunity to even get any information to those teachers,so they have a political monopoly in the schools.

**spk_0:** [10:15.23 - 10:24.10] You mean the,uh,political action arm of the NEA hands out its political literature in the schools,but you can't hand out Eagle-Forum literature in the schools.

**spk_2:** [10:24.15 - 11:12.57] We can't hand out Eagle-Forum literature,but more than that,a candidate who is opposing a handpicked NEA candidate can't hand anything out in the schools,so they are essentially,uh,blocked from even.Campaigning,uh,why the other candidate has the campaigning done for him by the NEA.So that's why they were listening to what the NEA wanted and Planned Parenthood and the abortion clinics and,uh,the homosexuals instead of what we wanted.Now of course we know that the NEA's political agenda includes such things as homosexual and lesbian rights and abortion on demand.And sex clinics in the schools dispensing contraceptives without parental consent.So it's no surprise that they were in favor of this terrible AIDS and sex education program.

**spk_0:** [11:12.69 - 11:18.37] They want the schools to be able to give sex education to the children without parental consent,isn't that true?

**spk_2:** [11:18.48 - 11:50.53] Absolutely.We have a law in Nevada that does require parental consent for sex education,and they,uh,oppose that law.They want to be able to start sex education in kindergarten without parental consent at any time.So what our school board did was they simply listened to the NEA and did precisely what they wanted.Now what happened after that is that we got We had 4 school board seats up in our county and we got some real good candidates to run.They weren't all Eagle-Forum members,but a couple of them were.

**spk_0:** [11:50.69 - 11:54.84] And didn't you put out a piece of literature telling the truth about the NEA?

**spk_2:** [11:54.97 - 11:56.61] Yes,we did.It was just a single sheet.

**spk_0:** [11:56.86 - 11:59.59] It said,we're almost out of time.Tell us what happened.OK,

**spk_2:** [11:59.68 - 12:20.23] what happened was that we exposed the positions of the NEA and the candidates endorsed by the NEA,and I got a letter from the state NEA,uh,the.Head of the NEA here uh wanting,demanding to know where I got this information,the fact that they support teacher strikes and they support gun control and they they oppose teacher competency tests and they oppose merit pay and many other things.

**spk_0:** [12:20.34 - 12:25.84] And what about some of their radical resolutions?Did you have those on like,uh,supporting abortion and the rest,

**spk_2:** [12:26.07 - 12:44.79] uh,abortion and the fact that they support,uh,uh,no laws against marijuana and the nuclear freeze,uh,Equal Rights Amendment,and some of these other things.And uh we distributed,uh,many copies of this.It,it'd have been better had we done it earlier in the campaign.We just started a month before,but,uh,we didn't have the money.Well,

**spk_0:** [12:44.91 - 12:46.75] so what happened?Did the NEA protest?

**spk_2:** [12:46.99 - 13:03.38] Yes,they protested my distribution of this,and they demanded to know where I got the information.Well,I sent them,uh,copies and references for their own NEA national resolutions.It was in their own resolutions.I never heard a word back from them.

**spk_0:** [13:03.64 - 13:36.72] That's pretty funny.I'd like to tell our listeners that if you write for our packet this week,uh,it will have a copy of the current NEA resolutions in it,and you can read them for yourself.Uh,well,I thank you very much,Janine,for joining our program.Today and for describing your experience,I think that could be duplicated by many others at the state capitals,uh,but keep telling the truth about the NEA and I think that,uh,we,uh,will be able to advise parents of how they can go about electing representatives at every level who agree with the pro-family position.

**spk_1:** [13:37.38 - 14:33.19] And Janine,thank you.Information packets on the NEA and for that matter,information packets about past programs that you've heard on Phyllis-Schlafly Live are available,and they're extremely detailed reports on witchcraft,uh,sex education in the public schools,the new.Movement.Well,you can certainly write us and close $10.And by the way,that $10 helps us stay on the air live via satellites on the USA Radio Network.Here's our address.It's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.And this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.We'll be going to your telephone calls on the USA Radio Network,so you might want to jump in.We will have a guest next segment,but your telephone calls coming soon.We're at 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_3:** [14:40.86 - 15:36.23] If you want to join a winning movement that stands for traditional American values,join Eagle-Forum.Since 1972,we've achieved an unmatched record of success.One,we helped stop the anti-family Equal Rights Amendment.Two,we help preserve women.Traditional exemption from the military draft and combat duty.3,we preserved dependent wives and widows' benefits in Social Security.4,we halted the radical attempt to make child care a federal function instead of a family responsibility.5.We've achieved federal and state legislation to eliminate child pornography.Many of these fights will continue.We'll keep standing up for traditional values in many areas,but we'll need you too.Become a member of Eagle-Forum.Write for your membership application and include $15.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois.Alton is spelled A L T O N 62002.

**spk_4:** [15:43.62 - 16:38.01] The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,a place where the most powerful man in the world resides,the president of the United States.But what many Americans don't know is that some of our nation's most important decisions aren't made in the Oval Office,because according to the Constitution,the power to make laws was granted only to Congress and not to the president.That's why only Congress can declare war,raise and support armies,and approve treaties.The bill is passed.The Constitution,the words we live by.To receive a free copy of this great document and information about it,write Constitution,Washington DC 200063999.A message from the commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution and the Advertising Council.

**spk_3:** [16:39.15 - 17:37.88] Eagle-Forum has been a leader in America's pro-family movement since 1972,you see.Eagle-Forum stands for traditional family values.One way we support the family is that we push for laws and taxes that encourage mothers to care for their own children and encourage fathers to provide for them.All too often we've felt the liberal agenda of laws and taxes that impose disincentives on the roles of mother and father.Let's face it,a child's place is in the home.We'll continue to work hard for our traditional family values because we believe strongly that preschool children need their parents' loving care,not government care.How about becoming a part of our team?Our team of 80,000 men and women is growing,and you can be a part.Of a team that stands for pro-family values,write us today for a membership application.Just send $15 to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [17:38.42 - 18:02.07] This is Phyllis-Schlafly live on the USA Radio Network this week talking about the NEA,the National Education Association.Our second guest is Mr.John Becker,who's on the line from Fort Wayne,Indiana.John's a lifelong member,a lifelong time member of the NEA,and he's been receiving all the NEA publications and policy statements for.What is it,30 years now?

**spk_0:** [18:02.35 - 18:14.87] Long time.Thanks for joining us,John.I thought you might tell us a little bit about the due structure of the NEA and how much money that means goes into the coffers of the union at the national level.

**spk_5:** [18:15.31 - 18:45.00] Well,uh,I,you hit it right.I've been a member of the NEA or a teacher for 30 years,but not a member of the NEA,um.Each of the local school districts set their own.Costs for their local section of the of the uh what they call the unified teachers association,uh,the state,the local,and the national all joined together,and here it runs $345 which is quite a lump sum.

**spk_0:** [18:45.20 - 18:52.32] That's an annual fee for each teacher,for each teacher in our district,and that's divided between the national,the state,and the local,right out

**spk_5:** [18:52.32 - 19:09.43] of that,the state gets the largest amount.The NEA is hiding.The money that they do their political action with and so on by putting it into the state part.Our state part is $250 of that.The NEA gets $60 of it and our local gets 35 dollars.

**spk_0:** [19:09.59 - 19:14.03] How many members of the NEA nationally do you think there are?Hundreds of thousands.Oh,

**spk_5:** [19:14.15 - 19:18.31] there's over 1,700,000 members nationally in the NEA.

**spk_0:** [19:18.80 - 19:27.77] I understand their national budget is about $100 million and they have a choice piece of tax-free real estate in Washington for the headquarters for their lobbying,right?

**spk_5:** [19:27.93 - 19:34.87] And,uh,in fact,this week they are holding their national convention in Washington.It starts today,I believe.

**spk_0:** [19:35.15 - 19:45.01] Well,is there compulsion on the teachers to belong to the NEA?I,I've heard some tales of how teachers were really pressured to join and pay up.Well,

**spk_5:** [19:45.21 - 20:10.14] yes,they are.There is pressure on them.They like to tell them that if they don't,then all these bad things are going to happen to them.Um,but some of the older teachers who have been around a while,they can't pressure us into belonging to the NEA any longer,although I fell under a grandfather clause where back when I first started,I joined the NEA and became a life member.And

**spk_0:** [20:10.26 - 20:12.08] that means you get all their national publications,

**spk_5:** [20:12.43 - 20:12.67] right?

**spk_0:** [20:12.94 - 20:25.06] Well,tell us a little something about their,their resolutions.I've found that many teachers at the local level not only don't agree with those radical resolutions,but they really don't even know about them.

**spk_5:** [20:25.21 - 20:38.76] Well,that's the thing.At the national convention this week,they're going to vote on the set of resolutions on Political action that they want to take as far as federal funding of the schools.

**spk_0:** [20:39.29 - 20:40.69] Well,they're always for more money,aren't they?

**spk_5:** [20:40.79 - 21:03.04] Oh yes,in fact,you know,it's interesting that this education is not a part of the federal constitution and therefore it belongs to the states.But the NEA wants to have federal control of education by having federal funding and also by having a national licensing instead of state licensing of teachers.

**spk_0:** [21:03.12 - 21:15.52] Are they working with the Carnegie Foundation on that?They want to have a national licensing of teachers,and of course that would mean that the real control would pass out of the hands of the local people.

**spk_5:** [21:15.74 - 21:19.55] Right,the more they can take away from the local,the more that they are trying to do.

**spk_0:** [21:19.90 - 21:34.55] Well,as I've looked over their annual yearbook of resolutions,they include such things as counseling and contraceptives of pupils without parental consent.They want the schools to provide sex education without parental consent.

**spk_5:** [21:34.70 - 21:37.15] That all falls under their family life education,

**spk_0:** [21:37.86 - 21:52.01] but they don't want to pay any attention to parents.No.They,they think parents are a real nuisance to,uh,uh,be around.They want to,oh,they think parents are censors or right wing fundamentalists if they pretend to have an opinion.

**spk_5:** [21:52.37 - 22:09.25] That's interesting that Janine that you were just talking to said that in Nevada they're trying to get the children.In kindergarten and even pre-kindergarten,well,the NEA philosophy is to get the child by age 3 away from the parents because the parents will ruin them before they get a chance to work with them.

**spk_0:** [22:09.51 - 22:23.80] I find that our members from all over the country are reporting that the NEA is in the state capitals trying to have mandatory kindergarten and to lower the school age.And to bring children into the schools at the age of 3,

**spk_5:** [22:24.04 - 22:30.76] right?That's one of the pushes that they keep doing in their national agenda,and that'll be voted on again this time.

**spk_0:** [22:31.04 - 22:35.86] But the NEA has some resolutions that have nothing whatever to do with education.

**spk_5:** [22:36.36 - 22:53.44] Well,those are the reasons why I've basically left the association in that they want to have a political force.In fact,that the Democratic convention.They were the largest representative group in 1984 and 1988,and I heard

**spk_0:** [22:53.44 - 22:59.03] they had 200 members at the Atlanta convention that nominated Michael Dukakis.

**spk_5:** [22:59.28 - 22:59.60] Well,

**spk_0:** [23:01.08 - 23:02.74] that's a lot of,that's a lot of delegates,

**spk_5:** [23:02.75 - 23:04.10] a lot of votes from one group.

**spk_0:** [23:04.52 - 23:19.10] Well,it's more than any governor has.It's more than the governors of New York or California.I also heard that each one was given a payment of $1000 by the NEA for their expenses in attending the convention.Did you hear that?

**spk_5:** [23:19.58 - 23:42.53] I know that from the booklet that I have right in front of me in '84,they paid them each $300 for air transportation,and a $500 expense,loan was interest free.So I don't know if they actually gave them the $1000 but they gave them $300 to cover their airfare.And $500 of tax-free money or tax-free interest-free money.

**spk_0:** [23:42.69 - 23:54.94] Well,that puts them into quite a voting bloc,and they caucus separately,and anybody who is trying to get the nomination on the Democratic ticket would have to be responsive to that special interest group.

**spk_5:** [23:55.13 - 24:05.83] Oh,very much so.In fact,uh,Walter Mondale said that if he didn't have the NEA behind him,he wouldn't have,you know,enough votes,and of course he didn't have enough votes anyway.

**spk_0:** [24:06.41 - 24:25.45] Well,he did have the votes to get himself,uh,nominated in the Democratic convention,and I do believe that,uh,the NEA was an early endorser of Michael Dukakis.Well,thank you very much,John,for joining us on this program.We appreciate your giving us some firsthand knowledge of how the NEA functions.Have we got another call,Bruce?Oh yeah,

**spk_1:** [24:25.57 - 24:45.51] we have,uh,plenty of callers waiting to talk to you,get some advice on what they can do about the NEEA.We're at 1-800-736.3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.Let's go out to the newest Bot Broadcasting Company station in Modesto,California.Deborah over at KCIV.

**spk_0:** [24:45.64 - 24:50.24] Hello,Deborah.Hello there.Have you had some experience with the NEA?No,I haven't,

**spk_6:** [24:50.31 - 25:39.62] and I think that this is something I do not have any children,and I,I am appalled by what's happening in our public schools.I haven't been blessed with children yet,but I think that part of the problem is that we as conservative Christian people are so,um,I don't know,we want everybody else to do something for us.To me it shows that across the United States we have voted in conservative people,you know,presidents in our government.We need to get involved.Grandparents,just because their,their own children that have children are.Uh,you know,it's like they think that they'll just let them handle it.We need all to get involved in it.To me it's appalling that a child should be subjected to education,sexual education,you know,by the time they're in kindergarten.We're stealing the innocence from our children.

**spk_0:** [25:39.80 - 27:02.07] I think that's right,and most of these sex ed or family life programs that are going into the schools are K through 12,as they say,kindergarten through 12th grade.But,um,let me explain that it was the National Education Association that was responsible for the creation of the Department of Education.Ah,when they endorsed Jimmy Carter for president,that's what he promised them,and the creation of that department was a payoff.When Ronald Reagan ran for president in 1980,1 of his campaign pledges was that he would abolish the US Department of Education.Why didn't he do it?I'll tell you why.Because the power of the lobbying apparatus of the NEA at the national level is such that Ronald Reagan was nowhere near to having enough votes in Congress.The NEA makes money contributions to all the congressional candidates they want,and they are helped to be responsible for electing the majority,and the congressmen are paying attention to the political action money.So that's one of the reasons,and I hope,hope that people like you will become active in politics and,ah,help to elect good members of your school board,your state legislators,and your congress.That's the only recourse we have.Well,

**spk_6:** [27:02.11 - 27:21.89] with programs like yours and our new radio station KCIV in Modesto that we're finally getting some information,I think that maybe some people will stand up and take notice and realize that we have to get involved.Uh,these are our,these children are our future for our country,and if we want a Christian.Wonderful God blessed country like we've had for so many years,we have got to get involved.

**spk_0:** [27:21.96 - 27:31.39] I do believe that the truth is what will keep us free,and exposure is very,very important in this land of self-government.You bet.

**spk_1:** [27:31.70 - 29:33.78] And we hope you appreciate the important information you and your family are getting from Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Now,if you can,a gift,a short note,your hometown station's call letters,it would all be welcome during these opening weeks of Philly.Schlafly Live.Your notes and a contribution is a yes vote to keep this fine program on parents' rights and education going.A quick note that the opinions expressed on Phyllis-Schlafly Live don't necessarily reflect the opinions and views of your station or its management.1-800-736-3202.1-800-736-3202.We'd like to hear from you on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.We'll return.Serious about understanding education issues,you need to subscribe to the Education Reporter.The Education Reporter helps keep you informed about what public schools are doing throughout the United States.Find out about the alarming new age courses being taught in Alabama public schools.Did you know in a community college in New York State students can now watch pornography for credit?Stay informed on education legislation.The Education Reporter is a monthly.Publication that's available to you.How about writing to Eagle-Forum for your annual subscription?In fact,the education reporter would make a great gift idea for someone you know in the field of education.Send $25 to Eagle-Forum Education.Eagle is spelled like the American Eagle.Eagle-Forum Education,Alton,Illinois,62002.Alton is spelled A L T O N,Alton,Illinois,62002.On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and all your telephone calls in this segment and the following segment 1-800-736-32021-800-736-3202.Let's move out to Trenton,New Jersey over at WCHR.It's Larry.

**spk_0:** [29:33.90 - 29:36.39] Hello,Larry,what's your question or comment?Uh,yes,

**spk_7:** [29:36.53 - 30:36.17] Phyllis,um,I'm the Pennsylvania,uh,president of Teachers Saving Children.Uh,I don't know if you're aware of our organization or not.Um,no,I'm not.OK,um,well,actually I'm also a national secretary,but we're about 2 years,actually 3 years old,and we're trying to educate our own,uh,peers on what the union is doing,the resolutions,etc.Are you an NEA member?Yes,I am.Uh,actually,what got me involved in the union again,I've been teaching for about 14 years.And I didn't,you know,initially for the first I'd say 89 years,I didn't want to really have anything to do with union business as far as getting involved,running,etc.and when I became aware through our state representative in New Jersey,I live in New Jersey,I teach in Pennsylvania,uh,when I became aware that NEA was lobbying in the,in Washington.For,or I should say against the Hyde Amendment at the time for funding of abortion.

**spk_0:** [30:36.44 - 30:39.15] That's because the NEA is for tax funded abortions,

**spk_7:** [30:39.33 - 30:59.42] right,right.And since they were lobbying,you know,I was made aware of it at that time and I decided.You know,actually during that summer to do something about it,and my first reaction was to get out of the union,which I did for two years,making this statement as I,you know,told,uh,the uh local president,and,uh,

**spk_0:** [30:59.92 - 31:01.80] and so now you're back in trying to reform it.

**spk_7:** [31:01.95 - 31:05.86] That's what we're trying to do,and that was 2 years out,and now,you know,I'm back in trying to,uh,

**spk_0:** [31:05.95 - 31:11.07] well,I guess phase one is to alert people as to what the radical agenda of the NEA really is.

**spk_7:** [31:11.39 - 31:31.22] That's what we're,well,we're trying to alert them to,right,exactly,um,you know,the various resolutions that do not pertain to education,uh,directly.I mean,you could relate everything to education if you really wanted to,but as far as the classroom's concerned and,uh,membership,um.You know,rights,etc.there's a lot of issues that you've been talking about.Some of the oh

**spk_0:** [31:31.22 - 31:45.02] sure,the,the NEA has resolutions in favor of the nuclear freeze and against the Contras and all sorts of issues like that.Uh,well,Larry,if you will give us some of the literature of your organization,we'll be happy to include it in our kit.OK,

**spk_7:** [31:45.13 - 32:01.30] there's a telephone number you can contact,uh,Bob Pawson,who's director.In fact,he even ran,uh,twice now and just this past year is the second time for NJEA president,and,uh,you can get in touch with him in area code 609-298-4843.

**spk_0:** [32:01.84 - 32:06.00] Oh,all right,Larry,thank you very much for calling and good luck.And let's

**spk_1:** [32:06.00 - 32:08.76] move to Smithsburg,Maryland,and it's Sarah.

**spk_0:** [32:08.94 - 34:00.09] Hello,Sarah.Hello.What is your question or comment?Well,my comment is I'm a member of Save Our Schools,and that's a division of the Taxpayers Education lobby in Washington DC,and recently I received their member's report,and what it is that they claim,well,from Hello,yes,we're here.Oh,I'm sorry,I think someone's trying to dial the um.They go right ahead.Thank you.From the Department of Labor,they received the information about the board of directors of the NEA,and it's their job titles and how much they make.And it seems that Mary Ferrell,the president of the NEA,makes $159,890 a year.And this is a woman that's calling for more money to Improve education.Well,that's a pretty big salary.That's more than most of the cabinet officers get in Washington.That's a lot of money.And even they have listed down comp.Staff compensations and there's a Terry Herndon who is a former employee that makes nearly $15,000 a year.Oh,and he's not even employed now.No former employee,uh,but do they have other big salaries over $100,000 a year?Oh yes,many.Uh,Roxanne Bradshaw,who is on the board of directors,makes $136,000 plus.Well,I don't think the members,just members of the board of directors of General Motors,get that kind of compensation for being a director of the board.It would certainly be nice if I could make that kind of money.Here's their,their even their executive director Don Cameron makes $150,000 too.Well,how much is the total compensation for the NEA national staff?Uh,$30 million over $30 million dollars.

**spk_1:** [34:00.22 - 34:03.28] The NEA could help support this program,you know it well,

**spk_0:** [34:03.33 - 34:03.76] yes,

**spk_1:** [34:04.93 - 34:05.97] I'm sure they'd love to.

**spk_0:** [34:06.17 - 34:46.13] I think they could help support our schools also,you know,I've been invited on,many,uh,television programs,and they've tried to set up a debate between Mary Futrell and me.And somehow it's never come about.Somehow she was never available to debate with me on any of these education issues.Usually they send out members of People for the American Way to do the debating,but it's hard to get the,the NEA members,uh,to come out and discuss these issues,particularly those issues that pertain to parental rights in schools.Well,well,thank you very much,uh,Sarah,for calling in.We appreciate your call.

**spk_1:** [34:46.31 - 34:53.99] Let's work in another telephone call at 1-800-736-3202 on Phyllis-Schlafly Live in Seattle.Here's Sally.

**spk_0:** [34:54.20 - 34:56.74] Hello,Sally,what is your question or comment?Well,

**spk_8:** [34:56.82 - 35:05.34] I was going to comment on the NEA and And the resolution they adopted as far as having homosexual teaching in the public schools.Well,

**spk_0:** [35:05.46 - 35:06.21] tell us about it.

**spk_8:** [35:06.38 - 36:11.44] Well,uh,I read it in the Education Reporter in July of 1988,and that being one of the resolutions that they had passed,that we should have homosexual teaching in the public schools and,and that there should be homosexual counseling for students and And so on.And about a month later I had a reporter contact me here in Seattle,uh,stating that,uh,we had come out with a,a commission here in Seattle on children and youth proposing just such a thing by our some of our,uh,officials here in Seattle,and,uh,this had gone on with no one in the pro-family movement knowing about it,had not been invited to any of the,uh,public quote unquote testimony that was being given.And,um,So a lot of us,uh,got together,uh,started contacting other pro-family,um,groups in the area and people much concerned with this issue,and,uh,banded together and brought in professionals such as,um,uh,doctors and,um.

**spk_0:** [36:13.33 - 36:21.04] And you're telling us that this was a,a program to institute,uh,homosexual counseling in the public schools,

**spk_8:** [36:21.21 - 36:27.27] not just counseling,but also teaching in,in,uh,every health course here and health.

**spk_0:** [36:27.61 - 36:33.09] You mean teaching them how to do it or teaching them to accept it,teaching it as an alternate lifestyle.

**spk_8:** [36:33.33 - 37:00.89] All three of those,it would be taught.In fact,one of the quotes given by,um,one of these people who,who were trying to,to get in the public school system here,um,stated that when you teach about homosexuality,you should pretend that all the students in your classroom are homosexual and teach it that way.Assume that everyone is that way.And,and this is a course that,that you would have to take in order to graduate from Seattle

**spk_0:** [37:00.89 - 37:02.02] here,a mandatory course,

**spk_8:** [37:02.69 - 37:12.30] yes,yes,because health here in Seattle is mandatory,um,half a year of health to graduate.And that is what is so dangerous about this.

**spk_0:** [37:12.49 - 37:20.28] Ah,these are the same people who,when parents object to anything,accuse parents of trying to impose their values on other people's children,

**spk_8:** [37:20.54 - 37:20.55] right?

**spk_0:** [37:21.40 - 37:22.86] Yes,so what happened?Well,

**spk_8:** [37:23.02 - 38:06.21] so by getting other concerned people together,we,we formed a group and,ah,the Public Education Committee,and Put together what I think is a fantastic report and we also work together with ex-homosexuals,people who have left the the lifestyle and say that,you know,once homosexual you don't always have to be homosexual and that you can get out of it and we worked with,with these people and put together a report based on.Facts and we just tore all the myths apart.Like 10% of the population is homosexual and on down the line and uh had a press conference and received quite a bit of media attention on that.

**spk_0:** [38:06.53 - 38:10.45] Well,we're out of time,Sally,but what,what happened?Did the course go in the school or not?

**spk_8:** [38:10.49 - 38:26.89] No,it did not.In fact,uh,we really lobbied the,um,the school board members here,and it has been kept out.So with good information.You and by hitting them with facts,uh,they are reachable,but it,it's a lot of hard work.

**spk_1:** [41:01.17 - 41:14.28] On the USA Radio Network and through the facilities of KSIV Radio in Saint Louis,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live taking your telephone calls and let's jump right back in.Here's Bob in Bordentown,New Jersey over WCHR.

**spk_0:** [41:15.62 - 41:18.10] Hello Bob,what is your question or comment?Hi Phyllis.

**spk_9:** [41:18.24 - 41:23.12] Uh,we met briefly when you testified at the New Jersey,Constitutional Convention,uh,

**spk_0:** [41:24.73 - 41:26.10] thing that was an exciting day.Your state

**spk_9:** [41:26.10 - 42:03.56] president,Vera Roach was there.um.I'm an NEA member myself and have become something of a,uh,reform advocate,uh,on a national level.With the NEA,both through the NEA Reform Coalition and as a previous caller alluded to the group Teachers Saving Children,and our philosophy is work from within.There are so many people,good Christian people,conservative people who have quit the union and disenfranchised ourselves.That's exactly what the liberal left.control group in the union wants us to do to quit,to get out.

**spk_0:** [42:03.72 - 42:09.07] Well,do you think most of the teachers agree with the radical agenda and resolutions of the NEA or not?

**spk_9:** [42:09.24 - 43:00.26] Definitely not.The current power group in there used very good what's called communist dialectic.They started taking over the union over the last 30 to 40 years by using the rules of the union,how to run for office and so forth.And at a certain point,especially about 15 to 20 years ago.Many Christian or conservative leaders in the union started quitting,resigning in protest.Well,this is the same thing as our GIs at Normandy jumping out of their foxholes and running back to their ships.The enemy would have loved it.It's time for Christian teachers,for conservative teachers,people of good faith and goodwill to get back involved in the NEA,to use the same system to retake the elected positions at the local,county,state,and national level of the NEA.And simply kick the rascals out.Well,

**spk_0:** [43:00.38 - 43:08.50] tell me this.They're having their national convention this summer in Washington.What does it take to be elected a delegate to that convention that passes the resolutions?

**spk_9:** [43:08.86 - 43:49.60] From my perspective,and I know I'm putting my own spin on this,there are some protective layers that keep the average teacher,and by the way,many NEA members are not teachers.There are other things like secretaries or the school nurse,the librarian,etc.bus drivers.Most of us are sort of like kept out of that.It's very hard to become a delegate,so to say,but it's not impossible.But the thing is we have to start now.And if teachers in the various buildings,school buildings throughout America,simply became the local representative for their building.That would start to take the power away from the people that we consider to be the bad guys and put the stewardship of this authority back in God's people's hands.

**spk_0:** [43:50.15 - 43:54.52] Do you have,do you have an organization or a support group to help teachers do this?Yes,

**spk_9:** [43:54.85 - 44:28.99] Teachers Saving Children is in something like 35 states now plus Canada,and now that started out about 2,2.5 years ago as a response to the NEA's pro-abortion policies.Not realizing what a can of worms we had opened up because at that point we were just asking questions.We are in the process now of incorporating another organization called NEA Reform Coalition.Not everybody that's angry at the NEA is necessarily hot to trot on the abortion issue,but they're angry at the union for their own reasons.Well,they've got

**spk_0:** [44:28.99 - 44:31.99] 100 radical resolutions.You can be angry at any of them.

**spk_9:** [44:32.15 - 45:20.86] Last year I sent a letter,I'm sorry,2 years ago I think it was,I sent a letter to the editor.To the most important papers in all 50 states,and many of them published it,scolding the NEA for taking positions on especially non-educational issues.One of the things that I was most alarmed about was that the NEA National Convention passed a resolution.Requiring the,um,staff at NEA in Washington to keep a dossier,a series of folders on what they considered people to be enemies of the NEA.Um,the ironic part of it,of course,is that most of the NEA's enemies are members of the NEA,and we resent having to have our dues pushed into causes that we don't believe in.

**spk_0:** [45:21.27 - 45:28.24] Well,thank you very much for calling,Bob.I'm sorry we're out of time.We want to take one more call before this program is over.Maybe you'll call another day.

**spk_1:** [45:28.39 - 45:29.15] Here's Alice

**spk_0:** [45:29.15 - 45:29.47] in

**spk_1:** [45:29.47 - 45:30.25] Virginia.

**spk_0:** [45:30.63 - 47:51.31] Hello,Alice.What is your question or comment?I saw recently a book review on this blackboard blackmail.And I was astounded that a woman who writes a letter to the editor criticizing or maybe critiquing NEA policies,she was sued,and,uh,who was she sued by?I understand she was sued by the NEA,and,uh,don't,don't they believe in freedom of speech?Well,this is my problem.Uh,how can a person,an individual,defend themselves against a big organization?I mean,think of the cost that she went through and the emotional trauma.She had to go hire a lawyer.Apparently so.I mean,you have to defend yourself,and this becomes costly,and I understand she had children and she had to go and document everything that she,uh,said in the original letters to the paper.And,uh,you know this is going to keep a lot of people from speaking out if they think a big organization has the power to sue them or you just don't have time or money to defend yourself.It's very intimidating to be sued.Most people don't have that much to do,uh,with lawyers,and they're,they're very panicky when they get a summons to appear in court.Well,what happened?is it over or is it still going on?I,I don't know.I wondered if you knew some more about it and,and could you,uh,I thought possibly it crashed your,uh,Well,I,I think that she won her case.I,I think it didn't go to court.I think that they settled,the,they settled out of court,and,ah,the NEA gave up suing her,and,ah,she stuck her ground and found that,that,ah,everything she said was true.I think she got more.than she wanted to.I mean,I think this is terrible,but when,when somebody has to be sued for using their First Amendment speech and what you say is correct and the newspaper bothered to print it and inform people about something and then you turn around and you have to suffer a lawsuit,this is,uh,I appreciate your calling,uh,this to our attention,and,uh,I agree with you.I think you should have the free speech to write a letter to the editor of your newspaper and criticize the NEA.Ah,so I'm glad she,ah,didn't have to pay any damages.I'm glad she,in effect,ah,won her case through settlement.So thank you very much,Alice,for calling.Uh,Bruce,this has been quite an interesting day.We've had a lot of NEA members call.Yeah,and if

**spk_1:** [47:51.31 - 48:00.75] anything,we've certainly found out that all the teachers and members of NEA don't necessarily agree with those official policies.No,

**spk_0:** [48:00.83 - 48:08.83] a lot of them don't even know what they are,but if you send for.Our $10 packet,we will have a copy of the NEA resolutions,and you'll be able to find out how they are.

**spk_1:** [48:09.01 - 48:25.86] Yeah,do it today,will you,because it does help us stay on the air and gives you extremely valuable information.Write to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.From the east to the west,we're standing proud.
