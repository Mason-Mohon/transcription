**spk_0:** [00:02.35 - 00:11.04] Do you think children in public schools should be asked questions which invade their personal and family privacy involving what they and their parents do at home?

**spk_1:** [00:11.74 - 00:51.56] Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.I'm Bruce Hayes.We have a program today about school board policies that.Pertain to what the public schools can or cannot ask children in school.Do you think schools should ask such questions as what sort of person are you?Why don't you like to go to church?What do your parents think of you?If you were an animal,which one would you rather be?What things embarrass you?We won't be taking your calls today because we've prerecorded several important guests that are lined up for this program,and we want to give them every minute of our available time.Now,if you've found a problem with your local public schools and wish there were a school board policy to cover it,well,stay tuned.

**spk_0:** [00:51.83 - 01:06.86] Our guest today is one of the pioneers in the whole field of parents' rights in public school education.Mr.Malcolm Lawrence is the coordinator of the Maryland Coalition of Concerned Parents and a valiant and persistent advocate of parental rights.

**spk_1:** [01:07.01 - 01:09.14] Annie's on the line with us now from Chevy Chase,

**spk_0:** [01:09.22 - 01:12.17] Maryland.Hello,Malcolm,thank you for joining us.Hello,

**spk_2:** [01:12.26 - 01:13.98] Phyllis,good to be with you again.

**spk_0:** [01:14.34 - 01:30.88] I know you've been a longtime defender.Of parental rights in public schools,you must feel very pleased that the Montgomery School Board of Education in Rockville,Maryland has just adopted a board policy that you've been working on for years.Let's start by your telling us about that board policy.Well,

**spk_2:** [01:31.00 - 02:09.00] the board policy,which was approved in just this past July 11th.Uh,for the first time puts in front of the 100,000 students and their parents as well as all teachers and administrators,the very sensible policy that,uh,teachers and,and curriculum may not get into the personal matters of students,their views,uh,their feelings,their emotions.It may not involve them in,in the life death decision games and all the things that that you and I and thousands of parents throughout the country have been fighting for now.It's true.This is only one school district,but there are 100,000 students.

**spk_0:** [02:09.11 - 02:12.05] It must be one of the largest school districts in the country.It is,

**spk_2:** [02:12.13 - 02:33.58] and it's right next to the District of Columbia.A lot of,a lot of congressmen and senators live here.A lot of,of course,the state delegates live in Montgomery County and,uh,and influential people who can get the word out.Now we're hoping that this will,will serve as an example to other school districts in Maryland and of course,uh,uh,as well throughout,uh.Uh,throughout the country well,

**spk_0:** [02:33.66 - 02:48.84] this thing of,uh,privacy invading questionnaires and psychological treatment in the classroom,uh,that's what we've been working on since those hearings of the Department of Education back in 1984 which we published in Child Abuse in the Classroom.It's the same issue,isn't it,Malcolm?

**spk_2:** [02:48.94 - 04:01.00] It,it is the same issue,but in fact this policy passed at the local level goes even further because it,it cuts across all sources of financing and doesn't,uh,pertain.Only to federally funded curriculum and classroom exercises,regardless of the source of funding,students now may not be involved in these discussions,and in fact if they detect them,they can,they can just clam up.Not only do the parents have the right to ask for an alternative assignment,but,but for the first time they can say they do not want their students involved in this.Furthermore,the students themselves can do it,you know.Several years ago,Phyllis,you,you,the Eagle-Forum put out something called the Student Bill of Rights,and,uh,right after teaching how to,how to speak and read and write English,uh,number 2 was the right to privacy,and it said that students have this right,uh,not to play magic circle or answer questions or write assignments.Well,we think this is a pretty good breakthrough,not because there wasn't officially a record somewhere in the Montgomery County,uh,school system,but for the first time.Uh,they are going to print this in their forthcoming edition of Students' rights and responsibilities.You mean

**spk_0:** [04:01.00 - 04:05.04] it won't be,it won't be a secret rule.Everybody will know about it and know what their rights are.

**spk_2:** [04:05.36 - 04:39.94] That's right.And,and this,this is carried home to the parents,and obviously the classroom teachers know they're not supposed to do it,and the students themselves know that there's a distinction between,uh,learning about emotional problems in the classroom and then having themselves involved personally in these emotional problems.And of course the second thing is,uh,It is against regulations now and so we think that the children will benefit from this and it'll get more into the learning process rather than into the so-called affective domain where the students' fears and rights and things are discussed openly in the classroom.

**spk_0:** [04:40.06 - 04:48.61] I noticed that the policy says that classroom discussion should ordinarily.Be external in focus.Explain what that means.Well,

**spk_2:** [04:48.69 - 05:41.46] it means that that they should focus on the on the subject matter and the skills that were the purpose of the curriculum in the first place,and it was not,we'll give you an example of this.If they're reading a story about stealing.And,uh,and the students are asked to discuss the relative merits of the story,uh,about whether somebody should have been punished or not,uh,that can be done,but when you get into the area of students being asked if they themselves have stolen and if so what happened to them and do they think they were justified,then this is the sort of thing that this privacy.Uh regulation does not permit.So it's a big step forward.It's the whole battle that,uh,that,that was fought in the mid-seventies in the West Virginia textbook case that uh they got involved in the children's psyches and their personal lives and and the parents were in an uproar over this.

**spk_0:** [05:41.76 - 05:44.86] Well,how long did it take you to get this policy adopted?

**spk_2:** [05:45.51 - 06:30.56] Well,well,when I headed a group called Parents Who Care 15 years ago,I,I,I took the Montgomery County school system to court,and one of the,one of the things,one of the battles we won there was to,was to get regulations against privacy.But the,uh,the important thing to remember here is that even though a school system issues a regulation,uh,once 15 years ago,it doesn't mean they keep it current,so they had some things on there.Administrative shelves,but each 2 or 3 years you have a whole new generation of students,and every decade you have generations of teachers.And unless you put this in a current document,an ongoing document,the new crop of students and teachers simply do not know that such regulations were issued,and that's what we've been doing over the past 2 years.

**spk_0:** [06:30.72 - 06:39.25] And now you've got it right out where it'll be in the hands of every student and parent.That's right.What were the incidents in the schools that made this policy necessary?

**spk_2:** [06:39.83 - 07:30.59] Well,some of,some of them were read at the top of your program,you know,how the questions that were put to students,those nosy questions,yeah,they were right from Montgomery County,Maryland.I sent you some,some of these examples,but just to let our audience know,when a child is asked how do other people see you,immediately you can,you can see all kinds of.Emotional things being triggered.Other questions are,who are you?Are you shy?Do you have good intentions but always do the wrong thing?What is the source of your anxiety?Now,how,how about that for a question for an 11 or 12 year old?Another question,why are you always timid?And,and,uh,one you use,why don't you like to go to church?And,and this one is a killer.Why are you an outcast,a loner?See,it's all presumptuous,uh,that,that there's a negative casting on this,and do

**spk_0:** [07:30.59 - 07:34.70] you think that the asking of these questions is very widespread in the schools?Oh yes,

**spk_2:** [07:34.75 - 08:15.00] I do.Ah,I,I think it's a technique that's been put in the schools,uh,oh,it's been in there some 15 or 20 years,a whole new approach to the,uh,so-called affective domain,how do you think and feel,uh,about certain things rather than what you know about them.Now it's all right to teach children,uh,how to think,but first you have to teach them things to think about.And one of the things you don't want to,uh,uh,get a child involved in,in a classroom.would be his inner feelings and himself.I mean,you're supposed to go there and learn things and you're supposed to learn how to do things.You're not supposed to go in there and be psychoanalyzed as an 11 or 12 or 13 year old student.

**spk_0:** [08:15.28 - 08:30.86] Well,some of us do call that group therapy in the public school classroom,and,and that is very.Objectionable.Tell me,did you have much hostility or objection from the school system,the superintendent or the principal?How did they react to this policy?Well,

**spk_2:** [08:30.92 - 10:27.72] the reaction by the school board president was initially that the members agreed that this sort of thing should not be done.And 6 weeks after I wrote to them,I wrote to them in October 1987,which is almost 2 years ago.Six weeks later,I,I got a sort of a laundry list of things from the school board president as to what they were going to do about it,but nowhere in that laundry list did it say that parents and teachers and students would be made aware of of what they were to do or not to do in the classroom.Uh,so when they issued a two page administrative memo to principals,uh,in the fall of 1987,I went back and I said it's all fine and good to notify principals,but how do we know that principals are telling all the teachers or that they're giving them copies of this two page memo,and the most important ones to know of all would be the students and their parents,since this is what goes on in the classroom.Now that's where the battle took place,and it took me 18 months to get this thing out in the open.The,the superintendent,uh,asked,uh,a,uh,ad hoc committee to review the request of the Maryland Coalition,that is the request that I made on behalf of the Maryland Coalition to have these,uh,regulations put in the Students' rights and responsibilities statement,which is now revised every 3 years in Montgomery County.The committee met on this for 4 or 5 months and came back with a negative response.The answer that they gave was that these things have to do with teaching techniques and classroom activities and nothing to do with students' rights,whereupon I then issued a press release calling this absurd and,uh,accused the,the,and incidentally the superintendent of the schools went along with the committee.Report in his memo to the board,I called this absurd and accused him and his ad hoc committee of withholding vital public regulation information from students and parents.

**spk_0:** [10:27.80 - 10:29.69] And so this issue went to the school board,

**spk_2:** [10:29.80 - 10:48.61] and this issue went to the school board,and the school board overturned the superintendent,and,uh,after meeting on it 3 times,uh,they met on it in May,June,and July.They resolved,uh.Unanimously to put this in the students' rights and responsibilities.Now congratulations.

**spk_0:** [10:48.69 - 10:52.75] How many letters do you think you wrote on this subject before you finally got your victory?

**spk_2:** [10:53.05 - 11:57.50] Well,my,I have my file in front of me and it's about 1.5 inch thick.It's not just letters.I went before the school board on 6 separate occasions at a public session with the board and raised these questions,and And this is one of the messages you said.You used the word,I think,persistent at the top of the program.This is what you have to do.You have to not only raise it initially,but you have to keep going back and back and back and back and taking advantage of any break you can get.The break in my case was one school board member voiced publicly his objection to these and said that he supported the Maryland coalition.And,and I almost fell out of my chair because this is a rare,a rare thing to happen indeed when you're trying to get some changes in the system and even get the system to,to halfheartedly admit that they've made a mistake,but,uh,The other,and,and eventually the other board members went with him and they put the policy in,but you see,he put them in the position of saying that that if they didn't go along with it,they were in favor of the invasion of privacy in students,so we kind of turned the coin around on them.Well,

**spk_0:** [11:57.54 - 12:12.02] that was a tremendous victory,Malcolm,and we have your new school board policy on file with us in our kit available for other people,and I hope they can take it to their own school boards and try to get it adopted.As policy,wouldn't you think that would be a good idea?

**spk_2:** [12:12.14 - 13:00.78] It would be a very good idea,but I,I have a couple of pointers here if I have a minute or so to,to,to make these points that if they're going to do this,I,I think that they should know their facts.They should prepare their arguments well,and this is important,go as a group.They don't have to incorporate,just form some kind of a little group,236 parents,a dozen or whatever who,who are,uh,experiencing these,uh,exercises.Exercises and techniques in the classroom and,and go to,uh,initially go to the school,the teacher,the principal,and if necessary,then go to a board meeting and,and if the,and if the board members are,are,uh,being negative or,or saying that this is the first time it's ever happened,then,then you have to really go public,stick to your guns,and,and don't expect miracles in 30 days.But,uh,and,and don't devote your whole life to it for a year or two.

**spk_0:** [13:01.10 - 13:02.02] You have just,

**spk_2:** [13:02.10 - 13:23.92] well,no,you just strike when there's an opening,and you know the board meets maybe every month or 3 weeks or whatever it is,and that's the time to act.Go before them during that public period.Each,each board,or many boards I should say throughout America have a meeting with press and public,as they put it,and that's,that's the time to get your 2 or 3 minutes or whatever they'll allow you in.Well,

**spk_0:** [13:23.98 - 13:39.85] that was a great victory,and Malcolm Lawrence,you were also the Author of the sample letter for parents back in 1984 which parents used to tell the schools not to use values clarification techniques on their students.I think it had about 250,000 circulation,didn't it?

**spk_2:** [13:40.10 - 14:00.76] Well,it had 250,000 circulation,but it appeared in major magazines and newspapers,and I understand many parents clipped it and used it as a basis for registering their concerns with the school system.Now some,some.Four years later,I'm learning through correspondence and phone calls that the letter is still being used,and that's good because we want to keep this concern current.

**spk_0:** [14:00.98 - 14:11.71] Well,you've done a great job in getting a public school board policy and getting it distributed among the parents,so stand by.We'll break for announcements,and then we'll come back with another guest.All right,

**spk_1:** [14:11.78 - 14:18.45] will do.And this week we're talking about school board policies,so stay with us on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_3:** [14:23.23 - 15:19.93] Too many children have been cheated out of the education they deserve.Did you know that nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science?That's a problem we can no longer afford to ignore.Educational excellence in the public school starts with respect for the rights of students,parents,and taxpayers.But what are they?Every student has the right to be taught to read the English language in the first grade.Every student has the right to family privacy,the right to his religious faith and beliefs,the right to share information with his parents.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy from Eagle-Forum.Learn more about the rights you and your children should expect.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy by writing Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_4:** [15:22.83 - 16:08.21] From the east to the west we're standing proud.From the north to the south we're standing proud.Like trees Our Constitution Still standing.Constitution is still standing.Kept us,it's made.Can beagle soaring high above.The

**spk_1:** [16:22.70 - 16:47.29] Welcome back to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.You know,Phyllis,a little bit earlier in your conversation with Malcolm Lawrence,I heard the mention about that student bill of rights,and it's absolutely free.And if you'd like to write in for Phyllis's student bill of rights,it's available to you.Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.And that's also a yes vote to keep this fine program on parents' rights and

**spk_0:** [16:47.29 - 17:13.78] education going.And those student bill of rights are the rights that you ought to get your local school board.Recognize our next guest is on the line from Nevada.Janine Hanson is our Eagle-Forum chairman out there,and she's been active in public policymaking in the education issue.Are you there,Janine?Yes,I'm here,Phyllis.I think you had a similar experience in Nevada where public school children were asked personal nosy questions,and there was an uproar that followed.

**spk_5:** [17:14.03 - 17:45.43] Yes,in fact,this has happened all over the state,but where we had a significant victory was in Lyon County.Lyon County is a rural county.Uh,about 60 miles outside of Reno,and there were some questions asked there in the elementary school which included some of the ones mentioned earlier,but I think a couple that,uh,he didn't mention was they wanted to know,uh,when the child took a bath and,uh,they wanted to know what they had for breakfast.And who their doctor was and if their parents,uh,drank beer and how often and if their parents were living with someone else.

**spk_0:** [17:45.63 - 17:47.60] Well,those things are none of the school's business

**spk_5:** [17:47.90 - 18:12.79] absolutely but this program was done,uh,under the auspices of the federal government and their drug,uh,program which requires that the school districts,um,have certain kinds of questionnaires.Although the the questionnaire wasn't required by the federal government,it was suggested and then it was tailor made for Lyon County School District.Now they couldn't get the money.

**spk_0:** [18:13.99 - 18:39.63] Janine,let me say that a lot of schools are saying that they need to have these questionnaires because of the Drug Free Schools and Community Act funds,but the law doesn't require.That all the law requires is that you present evidence that you have a drug problem in your community,and my answer to that is just turn on the television and you'll see what the drug problem is.They don't need to ask children to inform on their parents.

**spk_5:** [18:39.84 - 19:36.46] Well,that's exactly right,Phyllis,but the people within the school district that want to use this as an excuse to get all kinds of information on the students are using this drug-free.Uh,program from the federal government to,to,as an excuse for these questionnaires they had a big uproar in Lyon County about it.They went to the school board,uh,several times.Uh,I attended the,the last meeting that they had where they adopted the policy,and they did adopt a policy similar to the federal Hatch Amendment and the local level which prohibited these.These particular questionnaires,so it and it was by unanimous consent,uh,excuse me,there was one person that didn't vote for it because he thought it should have been stronger,but in the final analysis they did have a victory and unanimous consent.But the sad thing was is that the next year the same thing happened over again even though they were supposed to be getting parental permission to do any of these questionnaires.

**spk_0:** [19:37.76 - 19:45.83] So even though they had a school board.Even though they had a school board policy,the school went right ahead and,and,uh,put in the questionnaire the following year.

**spk_5:** [19:45.93 - 20:06.86] That's exactly right.They changed it some,and so a parent has to be continually on guard as to what's going on in the classroom.And of course,you know,they tell the children not to bring the questionnaires home and not to tell their parents.So unless you alert your children ahead of time,you probably won't find out.Well,going on in a particular classroom,

**spk_0:** [20:07.04 - 20:16.03] when you talk about the Hatch Amendment,you mean the Federal Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment for which the regulations were made very strong in 1984,

**spk_5:** [20:16.52 - 21:38.12] but that's so well outlined in your book Child Abuse in the Classroom,which we used as a handbook for the victory in our Lyon in Lyon County.Now one of the great things that happened out of the fact that we did win in Lyon County was the Assemblyman in our state legislature who represents Lyon County also happens to be the speaker of our assembly or our lower house,and he took that piece of,uh,legislation from the school board,that piece of policy making,uh,program,and put it into legislation for the state legislature,and although we didn't win this very first time that we presented it to the state legislature,we had some very positive results from it.One of those was that one of the assemblymen who you certainly couldn't say was conservative or interested in family issues.He was absolutely appalled and shocked that these kinds of privacy invading questions were being asked,and as a result of that there were some 13 members on the education committee we were able to win over and uh get educated.Several important members of the state legislature,the NEA came in and squelched our opportunity at this time to get it passed on the state level.But we've made some real inroads and opened some eyes there,and I think in the future we'll be able to get it passed on the state level.

**spk_0:** [21:38.42 - 21:49.92] And you found that the NEA,the National Education Association,uh,was endorsing these privacy invading questionnaires and working very hard against any efforts to eliminate them.

**spk_5:** [21:50.30 - 23:17.63] Absolutely they are totally against eliminating these types of policy.Uh,policies that invade students' privacy.They want to be able to do whatever they want to in the classroom and the parents to have no say.And when you start objecting to any kinds of programs in the schools,the NEA is the very first organization.That responds,uh,that they should have the right to do whatever they want to in the classroom with your children,and they came and testified at the legislature in opposition to this,uh,policy which would have prevented the schools from invading parents' privacy.We had some powerful testimony not only from Lyon County but from five other counties including Churchill where they were using,um,mood modifying,uh,relaxation tapes.They had originally been designed to help students with severe emotional handicaps,and they were being used in 1st and 2nd grade in Churchill County,um,without any kind of,uh,supervision from,uh,psychologist or psychiatrist who might be able to,uh,monitor the impact,and other counties,uh,not only talking about,uh,questionnaires as you mentioned this morning,but other.Kinds of,uh,psychological testing and,and,uh,invasive practices that were very harmful.Well,

**spk_0:** [23:17.75 - 23:31.79] Janine,let me ask you,uh,was this policy that you got adopted in Lyon County and tried to get adopted in the state,was it to prohibit this type of psychological treatment or questionnaire,or was it to get parental consent before they did it?

**spk_5:** [23:32.97 - 24:02.69] It provided for parental consent before they did it that they could not do it unless they had parental consent,but the other thing that it did was to,um,Refocus the emphasis of the classroom on academics rather than on non-academic subjects.And so if it was a non-academic program that had nothing to do with academic achievement,uh,then it had to achieve parental approval.

**spk_0:** [24:03.68 - 24:13.65] Uh,let me go back to Malcolm.Are you still there,Malcolm?Did you,did you make any effort to get your policy adopted by the state legislature in Maryland?

**spk_2:** [24:14.60 - 24:22.51] Well,we have over the years tried to do that going back as far as mid 1970s without any success.Is that

**spk_0:** [24:22.51 - 24:25.61] because of the power of the NEA because of

**spk_2:** [24:25.61 - 24:52.08] the Maryland Association of Teachers that is linked with the National Education Association.They would come in very heavily in favor of so-called academic freedom in the classroom,and that they called these attempts.Attempts at censorship and book burning.I mean they really use the labels and,and,and,and we have a very liberal county anyway,but when,when you,uh,and liberal state incidentally,well,

**spk_0:** [24:52.12 - 25:32.90] you have a liberal district in Montgomery County.And I think it's really amazing that in this tremendous district,uh,you got it adopted as school board policy,and now we hear from,uh,out in Lyon County,Nevada that they're able to do substantially the same thing.So I think this is a tremendous inspiration to people around the country.And I would suggest to anybody listening to this program that you can write to us and get copies of these school board policies.Uh,the school board policy,as Malcolm has pointed out,is even more valuable than the federal law because it applies to state funds,and they'll tell you,won't they,Janine,that most of the money in the schools is state money rather than federal money.

**spk_5:** [25:33.18 - 25:47.86] Yes,and even if it is federal money,they use the.Excuse that it's state or local money so that you,uh,can't get these,uh,the testing and other pro uh problems that are going on corrected because they know about the Hatch Amendment but they do everything they can to avoid having it enforced.

**spk_0:** [25:48.32 - 26:05.27] The,uh,Drug Free Schools and Community Act,however,is federal money and,uh,anybody who is being victimized by these nosy questionnaires as part of that program,uh.You should know that that is under the pupil Protection Amendment of the,uh,federal regulation.

**spk_5:** [26:05.46 - 26:40.30] I think that parents need to alert their children ahead of time.Now it's time to get ready to go back to school.They should tell their children if they get any kind of these questionnaires,and they should maybe give them a few of the questions or some of the things that might be on there to alert their children that if they're faced with this in school,that they should refuse to take it.Uh,and that they should get a copy of it if they can and bring it to their parents,but parents should go to the school ahead of time and,uh,put in the letter which Malcolm has talked about or even a handwritten letter telling them that they do not want their children participating in any of these questionnaires.

**spk_0:** [26:40.76 - 27:04.84] That's a very,very good suggestion.We will try to develop a list of questions for people who write in that you can be on your guard about.Most children,however,are told they cannot bring these questionnaires home,but I think the parents should be able to tell the child,if you see any nosy questions about what's going on in our family,don't answer and bring it home.Uh,

**spk_5:** [27:05.06 - 27:36.72] my little boy who is,uh,was just 10 years old last year,he was in the 3rd grade.Uh,I told him that I didn't want him in any sex education or any drug education classes,and I had taken a note to the school district,but when the counselor came in to his classroom,he told his teacher,my mother told me that I'm not supposed to be in this drug education class,and the teacher took him out of the class and put him into.The library and so because he was aware of it ahead of time,he was able to take care of it himself without me interfering.Well,

**spk_0:** [27:36.84 - 27:40.08] good for you,Janine.We have to break for announcements.Don't go

**spk_1:** [29:05.99 - 29:28.98] Welcome back to P Phyllis-Schlafly Live.This week we're talking about school board policies.Phyllis,before we jump back into our guests here,just a quick reminder about the information packet on school board policies.So many people like to delve into the subject,and they certainly can with the materials that you have available at Eagle-Forum.$10.Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Your next guest is here,

**spk_0:** [29:29.30 - 30:02.47] right?Uh,you can also get a cassette of this program for $5 from Eagle-Forum.We go for our next.Guest out to Squim,Washington,where Bob Brownlee has been the citizen leader of a group that persuaded the school board a couple of years ago to pass a pupil protection policy very similar to the federal Protection of pupil Rights Amendment.Are you there,Bob?Oh yes,I'm here.You put in the policy a couple of years ago,I believe,at that time,believing it was for the protection of both pupils and teachers,and it was a good policy.You sent me a copy of it.

**spk_7:** [30:02.63 - 30:03.18] That's correct.

**spk_0:** [30:03.85 - 30:04.99] What happened after that?

**spk_7:** [30:05.83 - 31:13.71] Well,uh,after a policy is accepted by the school board and read twice into the minutes,uh,then the school board informed us that they had to send us away to the Association of School Directors to have it placed into the language of school policy.Uh,that took approximately 18 months.When this came back,there was no resemblance whatsoever of the school policy changes that the school board had accepted.So in a sense,it was an exercise of futility.Uh,we went through over 20 months of effort,uh,to have the Hatch Amendment or the Protection of Human Rights Amendment accepted as school policy,along with some other methods of accountability for teachers.Now,our main aim here is not necessarily to,uh,make sure that the children are receiving the right information.But during a committee meeting,meetings of a committee that was accepted and set up,we determined that our teachers are far outside the law on a daily basis.That's both federal and state laws,and they are ignoring the laws as they exist,particularly,

**spk_0:** [31:13.94 - 31:19.10] particularly and they were in particular,they were ignoring the school board policy that was adopted.

**spk_7:** [31:19.30 - 31:32.13] They were ignoring school policy that was adopted.They're ignoring the Hatch Amendment itself,uh,which is a federal law.They are further ignoring normal state laws that give good guidelines to educators as to what should be taught their children.So what

**spk_0:** [31:32.13 - 31:35.40] did you and your and your citizens group do about it?

**spk_7:** [31:35.57 - 31:56.58] Well,what we did about it was come up with a letter of affirmation,and in this letter of affirmation suggested that they are indeed outside the law,and the school board accepted the whole letter of affirmation.I believe I sent your office a copy of that.And that letter of affirmation names a number of laws that the state laws that the schools.are breaking on a daily basis.Well,

**spk_0:** [31:56.70 - 32:00.82] give us an example or two of what kind of laws they were breaking.Very,

**spk_7:** [32:01.14 - 32:06.66] very glad to do that.One law is what we call RCW 28A 67.110.0,

**spk_0:** [32:06.78 - 32:07.77] tell us what that is.

**spk_7:** [32:08.18 - 32:15.98] It says it shall be the duty of all teachers to endeavor to impress upon the minds of their pupils the principles of morality,truth,justice,temperance,humanity,and patriotism.

**spk_0:** [32:16.06 - 32:16.98] Is that a state law?

**spk_7:** [32:17.10 - 32:38.36] That's a state law.Now they do not teach patriotism in our schools at all.We have at the state level an office of the superintendent.He has a department that works for him,and this department has to do with multicultural education.Cultural education that they can put forth that they do put forth is based solely on values clarification.Well,

**spk_0:** [32:38.44 - 32:44.00] I,I think multicultural education is just a fancy name for global education,isn't it?

**spk_7:** [32:44.09 - 33:13.49] That's exactly what it is.We have this in our schools now.Our new school policy that came back after 2 months.First of all,our purpose was to get rid of global education.It came back in the form of multicultural education,and it says that this multicultural education should permeate every classroom of our swim school.That's in the face of 20 months before a committee that put out a new school policy that was totally accepted that said this is no longer going to be with us.

**spk_0:** [33:13.80 - 33:15.33] So what did your school board do?

**spk_7:** [33:15.50 - 33:47.22] Our school board has accepted this policy as it came down from WAA that says that multicultural education,or globalism if you will,will permeate every single classroom in the swim schools.Now we,we questioned these people again,and they said,Well,I'm sorry,that's the policy we accepted 18 months ago.Uh,this is a whole new ballgame now.We have all new players and so they decided that we'd have to go through this whole routine again,form another committee,another 18 months of trying to get rid of this policy.Well,

**spk_0:** [33:47.43 - 33:52.11] would you say that what the school system did was to give you a stall technique?

**spk_7:** [33:52.75 - 33:53.95] That's exactly right.

**spk_0:** [33:54.72 - 33:55.90] So where are you now?

**spk_7:** [33:56.04 - 34:29.91] Well,right now we have ignored the swim schools and we've gone into the state of Washington to try to educate the teachers as well as the parents.One of our aims in educating the teachers is that we know they do not know the.Nor have they been briefed on the law.They have been taught the way to teach is to use the psychological therapy as placed,uh,as put out,uh,by people such as,uh,Rogers and Maslow in the beginning.I think there was a man named Coulson who was trying to undo that horrible.therapeutic You're talking

**spk_0:** [34:29.91 - 34:32.77] about Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow.

**spk_7:** [34:32.85 - 35:07.12] That's correct.Now,that's what they're teaching in our schools today.We're trying to let teachers know that these methods of teaching are in violation of federal and state law.But we're not getting very far with this.We have probably had well over 2000 people briefed in the last three years,and out of 1500 people briefed at a single meeting,maybe one will come forward and want to do something.So parents have been sent into a,uh,oh,I'd call an apathy,uh,mode.They want to hear,but they don't want to move forward and do anything.It's a very difficult problem.

**spk_0:** [35:07.64 - 35:47.28] Well,I think they're so baffled by the schools and the various techniques that the schools use to stonewall them.Now I don't know if you heard the earlier part of the program,but we also have Malcolm Lawrence on the line from Maryland.And he helped to put in a good school board policy a couple of years ago,but it was almost like a secret classified document.So then Malcolm worked on a plan to get it promulgated and put in every student's packet.Malcolm,do you have any suggestions for the people in Washington on how they can really publicize a policy after it was adopted by the school board?

**spk_2:** [35:47.88 - 36:18.84] Well,I,I didn't hear all the details of,of,uh,of what Bob's been doing,ah,you know,since,since the big turndown,but I,I would assume that he had a certain amount of publicity with his effort,and if,if not,he should certainly try to get more now.Ah,I,I think it's time for,for that group,uh,in Washington,in the state of Washington,to have a,a.A very effective press conference and try to blow this whole thing out of the water and and turn it back on the school system.

**spk_0:** [36:19.57 - 36:28.53] Uh,Bob,uh,Brownlee in Washington,uh,is that original school board policy still in effect,or was it ever rescinded or just ignored?Well,

**spk_7:** [36:28.65 - 37:16.38] it was accepted and read into the minutes.Uh,however,when it comes back from this Washington Association of School Directors,which is a state organization.Then,uh,is the set of words that they do go by.So it has been completely nullified.It's as if it never even happened.Uh,I do have Frederick County,Maryland's,uh,school policy,and,uh,we have written a book called,uh,We for Your Teachers.And that policy in Appendix L,uh,that Maryland had put out,uh,which is just excellent,is in this particular,uh,book as a guideline to both parents and teachers and school boards.But,uh,I did hear the,the gentleman's words,and we have tried very hard to have seminars across the state.Uh,when we invite the press,they never show up.

**spk_0:** [37:17.50 - 37:56.13] Well,I think perhaps you would both agree with me that the first step is to alert the parents as to what is going on in the schools,and that's one of the purposes of this radio program.I feel that the issue of what is being taught in the schools is the number one issue in our country today,but it has the silent treatment from the press,and what you both have done is simply tremendous.The only way I know to give it national coverage is through our radio live program and through our Eagle Forum's education reporter,because you certainly aren't going to hear about it on Dan Rather or,uh,or any of those national programs.

**spk_7:** [37:56.94 - 38:10.67] Well,I certainly agree with that,uh,Phyllis,and the Eagle-Forum has certainly taken a,a giant step ahead.Uh,the only reason why we ever started our program is because of Eagle-Forum and the particular,in particular,your book.That's child

**spk_0:** [38:10.67 - 38:11.66] abuse in the classroom.

**spk_7:** [38:11.76 - 38:23.20] That's correct.And we've passed out hundreds of copies of this book.Now many,many people across this state,if they ever held those 77 hearings in this particular state in 7 cities,you would see thousands of parents come forward.

**spk_0:** [38:23.99 - 38:29.53] Well,thank you very much.We appreciate hearing from both of you,and,uh,we're out of time.

**spk_1:** [38:30.15 - 38:45.29] Exciting conversation on Phyllis-Schlafly Live today.School board policies,and we'll have our address about how you can get a cassette and an information packet.Stay with us,and there's also more conversation to come on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_8:** [38:54.55 - 39:53.36] A national panel reported that 25% of 17-year-olds are functional illiterates.Another 40% are marginal illiterates.That means nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science.What have they been doing all those years in public schools?Sex education,death education,new age meditation,and other non-academic psychological activities.This can be stopped.US law gives you,the parents,primary control over your children's education.Find out about your rights.Read the Education Reporter.It's a monthly newspaper from Eagle-Forum.The education reporter keeps you informed about offensive school curricula and about victories won by parents who assert their rights.Write for a free sample of the education reporter.The address Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_6:** [39:54.20 - 40:51.04] Eagle-Forum has been leading the pro-family movement to victory since 1972.Eagle-Forum has achieved an unmatched record of success,stopping the anti-family Equal Rights Amendment,preserving women's exemption from the military draft in combat duty,working for federal and state legislation to eliminate child pornography.That's proof that citizen volunteers can determine government policies in Congress and in state legislatures,but the fight continues.Eagle-Forum is now working for a tax credit for every child,for parents and pupils' rights and education,for economic growth through lower taxes,for a strong national defense.And for private enterprise,join us,the men and women of Eagle-Forum who share conservative pro-family values with a faith in God,in America,and with hope for the future based on freedom and opportunity for all.Wright Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [40:53.86 - 40:57.40] On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis Schlaffly Live.

**spk_0:** [40:57.66 - 41:19.65] We're talking about school board policies today,and our next guest is Kathy Roden of Yucca Valley,California.She called in our parents' advisory Center and had a most remarkable tale to tell.It was about a high school English literature teacher turning over the class to the showing of R-rated videos.Kathy,uh,tell us how you discovered this and what happened.

**spk_9:** [41:19.94 - 42:01.67] Well,um,my son came home.Uh,from school and he was telling me that they,uh,well this was after they'd seen the 3rd film,uh,he was telling me that he had,uh,they were watching.Uh,movies in school and he says,gee,now we're getting into nudity,and I said,What are you talking about?And so he proceeded to tell me that he'd already seen 3 films and that his teacher had made a remark at the beginning of it to imply or encourage the kids not to come home and tell their parents.Because if they did,then they wouldn't be able to show the films anymore.She wouldn't be able to allow this to continue.

**spk_0:** [42:01.87 - 42:03.18] So what did you do then?

**spk_9:** [42:03.43 - 42:15.75] Well,because of a previous problem,I had gone to our school board two years ago and mentioned or told them about an incident where the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,which is rated R,

**spk_0:** [42:15.95 - 42:19.46] the Texas.The Chainsaw Massacre was shown in your school.

**spk_9:** [42:19.70 - 42:52.66] It was shown in a math class at one of the math class,yes,and so I had expressed some concern about the abusive use of VCRs in the school.So at that time our school board adopted a policy or came forth with a real firm.A directive instructing the principals to let the teachers know that they were not to do this.Now this teacher indicated to the students that she knew she was violating a district policy.In other

**spk_0:** [42:52.66 - 43:04.18] words,you're telling us that 2 years ago the school board adopted a policy about videos that was a good policy,but this year the teacher violated the policy and went ahead and showed the videos.She was violating.Oh yes.

**spk_9:** [43:04.46 - 43:04.90] Oh yes.

**spk_0:** [43:05.10 - 43:06.68] So when you took it up with the school,what happened?

**spk_9:** [43:06.98 - 43:51.23] Well,when I,when I took it,I took it to,uh,well,what wound up happening was,um,because they seemed to act like this particular teacher that showed the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,he was going to be losing his job,and he knew it.So it was kind of everybody kind of thought it was a revenge thing.So after my son had See these movies,I allowed it to continue because I didn't want them to say that it was an isolated incident or for her to be able to say that,well,I didn't know I was doing anything wrong and I wasn't planning to show any more movies anyway.Well,it wound up by before or by the end of the year she had shown 7 movies and out of those 75 of them were R rated.

**spk_0:** [43:51.92 - 43:54.33] 5 R rated movies rated

**spk_9:** [43:54.33 - 43:54.54] movies.

**spk_0:** [43:54.63 - 43:55.89] Now what kind of a class was this?

**spk_9:** [43:55.98 - 44:12.81] It was English.And then I found out that,uh,he had not even had a textbook since February.He,she didn't,she didn't give him a textbook.Um,I,I had no idea all this was going on.I just assumed,you know,

**spk_0:** [44:12.97 - 44:16.82] that,well,what is a teacher getting paid for just to turn on the VCR?

**spk_9:** [44:17.14 - 44:21.92] That's what our question was.I,I think to,uh,um,I,well,

**spk_0:** [44:22.01 - 44:24.04] so,so you,did you take it up with the school?Yes,

**spk_9:** [44:24.12 - 44:24.85] I did.So where

**spk_0:** [44:24.85 - 44:25.84] are you on that?Well,

**spk_9:** [44:25.89 - 44:54.01] what we did was we,in order to make it really effective,we took and filmed segment.of um just like a minute of 5 of these different films because I then I found out a whole bunch of films were being shown in other classes to other students.So anyways,we took 5 of these films and,and put little segments of it and we took it to the school board and made them sit there and look at what our son had had to see.And um

**spk_0:** [44:54.21 - 44:55.25] I hope they were in shock.

**spk_9:** [44:55.32 - 45:01.42] Oh,they were.I mean,no human person could have have not been shocked.

**spk_0:** [45:01.57 - 45:07.14] But in any event,what was done this year was in clear violation of the policy they already had.Yes,

**spk_9:** [45:07.33 - 45:09.18] yes,it was.And so

**spk_0:** [45:09.18 - 45:10.53] are they going to punish the teacher?

**spk_9:** [45:10.77 - 45:57.97] Well,this is where the frustration comes in.We have uh.California has some sort of legislation that has to do with uh uh tenured teachers or something.I,I'm not sure exactly what regulation it is,but there's something that stops them from firing this teacher on the spot.The very soonest that she could lose her job would be March 15th of next year.So that means she's still got 6 months where she,she can have a field day.It's very frustrating.Um,the school board has adopted a stronger,more stringent policy.Uh,it's in 30 day review right now and,uh,because they were very upset about the whole thing,and,uh,so,well,

**spk_0:** [45:58.06 - 46:09.09] I want to go back to our original guest on this program,Malcolm Lawrence in Maryland.And see what you think about this.Maybe you should have put videos in your school board policy,Malcolm.

**spk_2:** [46:09.54 - 47:00.70] Well,it,you don't have to put anything in the policy.It cuts across all classes,all subjects,and all kinds of materials and exercises.That's what's so nice about it.Uh,uh,you know,obviously if they were using,uh,films,uh,that are objectionable this doesn't really get into the privacy area,but if they're having discussions about it,uh,they would.I might comment,Phyllis,that several years ago we found some objectionable films and we put on a public,we sort of called a press conference and put on a public display of them,uh,much the way she did to the school board.And the result was the school system didn't say they were objectionable and didn't say they were taking them out,but in fact within the next school year all of those films were withdrawn from the school system very quietly,so you may be having more of an effect than you think you are.

**spk_0:** [47:00.91 - 47:27.43] That's right.There are many times when the school or the media may not admit that they've done anything wrong,but by lodging the complaint and making it public,they just don't,don't do it again.So we wish you luck,Kathy,in getting the school board to observe the policy that you got them to adopt a couple of years ago.I think publicity about this is very important.Most people are just shocked at what you have told us.

**spk_9:** [47:27.65 - 47:34.62] Well,we really need to.I think all of the parents,my awareness level has certainly been raised.

**spk_0:** [47:34.70 - 47:45.27] Well,that's a very important aspect of everything we're doing.I'm sorry we're out of time,but we thank you,Kathy,and we thank you,Malcolm,for joining on this discussion of school board policies.
