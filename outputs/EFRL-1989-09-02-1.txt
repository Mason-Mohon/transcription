**spk_0:** [00:01.53 - 15:09.61] The average teenager spends more time listening to rock music than he spends in school.Is that good or bad?And is it something parents and teachers should do something about?Welcome to Philly Schlafly Live.Good to have you along.I'm Bruce Hayes,and our newest affiliate this week in Honolulu is KLHT.Of course we'll be looking for your telephone calls,so jot down our toll-free number from anywhere in America.1-800-736-3202.Day and night,America's youth are enticed and entertained by electronic visions and sounds of a world that's loud,violent,sensual.Narcotic and even suicidal.The world of rock music is brought to them through cassettes,records,television,videos,and MTV.Now,should parents be concerned,and what's been your experience with rock music?Of course we'll be looking forward to hearing from you at 1-800-736-3202.Radio Li program every Saturday is dedicated to the issues involved in education and parental rights.Rock music is one of those issues whether it is through headphones or MTV.Rock music enables the young person to build a wall around himself where he's sealed off from parents and from most of the real world.And where he can get messages that are weird,immoral,illegal,and self-destructive.Most parents have no idea what is being communicated in this fantasy world in which their children spend so much time.Today to discuss this issue with us is Mrs.Shirley Marvin,a wife and mother in Missouri who's been active in Eagle-Forum.And has made a particular study of rock music and she's worked on legislation at the state Capitol in Jefferson City.Welcome,Shirley,and thank you for joining our program.Thank you,Phyllis.Happy to be here.How did you happen to get so interested in rock music?Well,I really didn't know much about rock music.I have young children.We're not involved in it,but I attended an Eagle concert in Washington,which is the Eagle Farum Conference,about 4 years ago,and at that time met Tipper Gore,who started the Parents Music Resource Center and saw her presentation and became very shocked and concerned with the issue.Her slides were very shocking,as I remember.Yes they were.They just,they brought tears in my eyes actually watching it and I,we brought her to Saint Louis shortly after that to do a presentation here in Saint Louis and she helped us start up,uh,the work that we're doing now.She's a very attractive woman and I think she started that along with Mrs.Jim Baker,Susan Baker,who is,uh,her husband is now Secretary of State.Well,let's establish first of all what is really.On rock music,most parents have never heard it or even if they did hear it they didn't understand the words.So tell us what rock music is.Rock music is,uh,very popular with teens.It seems to be a,a counterculture that they really look to for their messages,their words of wisdom.Uh,it has messages of suicide,violence,sexual perversion,uh,that degrades women.Uh,drug abuse,and these are the themes that the children are being fed constantly to.Well,to give us some examples of how the rock music lyrics,uh,uh,put forth some of these notions.For example,uh,take the murder and the violence.Uh,do you have some examples of that?Yes,I do,fellas.A group out now that's called Guns N Roses,which is a very popular group.It's hit number 1 on the Billboard charts several times.This particular song reached number 4,and it sold over a million copies,and it's called I Used to Love Her by Guns N Roses.Says I used to love her,but I had to kill her.I had to put her 6 ft under.I still can hear her complain.Uh,this is the type and this,this group has a predominant theme of depression and violence throughout all their songs.Oh,how dreadful.And the name of the group is Guns N Roses.Uh,what about,uh,suicide?I understand suicide is a,a recurring theme on rock music lyrics.OK,on suicide lyrics there is quite a few.Uh,first off,you can classify it as just very depressing music.That would lose cause children to really just lose hope in society.And then there are groups that are just very blatant in their songs.Uh,one group called Suicidal Tendency,Nothing Le imagination on that group,has many songs.Uh,one of them is called Pledge of Allegiance.Uh,their lyrics go,I was born to be suicidal.And I always will be suicidal.Don't get down on me,suicidal tendency.Then the chorus is suicidal,suicidal,suicidal.Well,the average parent seeing a cassette or a record that is called Pledge of Allegiance would get a very different impression of what's going to be on it.I understand there was a song put out by the group called ACD.DC that was called Shoot to Thrill where the singer talks about putting a gun to his head and pulling the trigger,so that must be a theme that comes back again and again.Well,Shirley,what about drugs?Um,we've,uh,been led to believe that the rock music people are very heavily into drugs and they sing about it in their lyrics.Yeah,quite a few groups too.Um,one group that,uh,has this as their theme quite often is the AC DC group that you spoke of.Um,as well as,um,trying to find a particular song here that I would like to quote to you on the suicidal theme.Uh,Ozzy Osbourne has sing,sang songs of suicide.He has a song Suicidal Solution.Uh,on his promotion for that,it shows him with a gun pointed to his open mouth,uh,and,but he repeatedly says that he is not encouraging suicide at all.You mean,uh,showing the gun.You're talking about MTV now.Oh no,on rock magazines,uh,in his promotional,that's the way they advertise the rock music in the in the,in the ads,Beastie Boys,a very popular now number one,has one called Hold It Now Hit It says I'm never dusting out because I trust that crack and this theme is repeated over and over in the song.He sing and talk about how they really depend on their drugs,their crack.Uh well,what about the sexual part?Aren't some of these lyrics very sexually explicit?And I'd better warn you,our listeners may have tender ears,so don't give us all the lyrics that you've got in front of you.OK?I'm going to give you one that is explicit,but I'd like to say that,as you pointed out,Phyllis,these songs are unbelievably explicit,and I can't even repeat them at this time.Uh,this is,we do.This songs by Prince,very respected,you know,he gets on well-known magazines and has a song called Scandalous,which is the theme song to the Batman movie that is out now.It's called Closer.Feel You've Been Dying.Don't be afraid,baby.Touch it and explode.I can't wait.I can't wait to wrap my legs all around you,girl tonight.Why don't you,we skip all the foreplay,mama,and just get down here on the floor?And that's one of the popular,uh,singers in the rock music group.Uh,well,what about,uh,the effect that this has on the young people?I,uh,read an article recently in US News and World Report,uh,in which they interviewed Doctor Bruno Bettelheim,the famous psychologist,and he talked about rock music as an addiction.Uh,he called it an addiction that was similar to an addiction to drugs.Do you find that that it has that effect?The young people want to hear it and hear it and hear it over again and hear more of it.What is your experience with that?That does seem to be the case.As a matter of fact,uh,the argument you made have so often,parents will say,Oh,I can't understand what the words say,and I'm sure my children don't.Because of that phenomenon of the addiction,they do listen to it repetitively over and over until they can decipher what their hero is trying to tell them.In a way,I think the the message being so muffled and difficult at times is part of the reason that they become so addicted to listening to it.Well,it's so loud too.It,it really hurts your ears.In fact,I saw an article or a segment on.A CBS Evening News not too long ago in which they're just discovering the terrible effect that this loud music has on the ears of the young people and causes major damage later on.I believe some of the famous rock music stars are now realizing that their hearing is damaged.Have you found that?Yes,there's a lot of document cases on that,particularly,as you mentioned,with the rock stars that have Come out now and said that they do have very,very damaged hearing.Why do you think the young people are so attracted to this type of,I hesitate to call it music,um,what is it?Is it,is it peer pressure?Is it,uh,rebellion?Dr.Bettelheim offered a few other examples of explanation.He said he felt that there was a gap in the lives of young people which they wanted to fill with something,and this seemed to be available.Or perhaps it's a way to assert their independence,their rebellion against their parents.Do you think it has all that in it?I think so.Most studies will show that.Every generation has had their music and at different levels of intensity it's just progressive at this point now and it is a form of rebellion.I am really convinced of that.that they seek this out because it is so disgusting to most of their parents.So it is something that they want.That's a problem that needs to be dealt with within the family.Well,I,I don't think it's all explained by saying every generation has its music now.I saw an ad recently to get a cassette of the old Hit Parade that used to be a top radio program in the 1940s,and I just happened to play this in my cassette recorder in my car on the way coming to this program.And it was they had Tommy Dorsey and he played all those wonderful tunes like I'm getting sentimental Over You and As Times Go By and I'm in the Mood for Love and I Can't Give You Anything but love and all these songs are about love and they also have a feeling of togetherness in that they have nice feelings about other people and when it's dance music,it's a dance that other people share the same steps and and the same.A motions that you're going through,and I don't think it's just an age difference.I think the rock music tends to isolate the student,doesn't it?He builds a world where he's alone.If they dance,they're not dancing that in a way that has anything to do with their partners at all,and they certainly cannot communicate.They can't understand what they're saying to each other.So it seems to me there must be something more to rock music than simply a new age and of people having a different form of music.Do you have any comment on that?Well,it's an angry type of music,and it is angry.It's all angry,isn't it?And I think that we're seeing that a lot of the anger that is built up in our young teens now,they're,they're using this as to as either an outlet or a way to feed it.Of course I think that it is encouraging the anger.Or to develop more,it is not an outlet for it.Well,when I look back at the swing music of Tommy Dorsey,Jimmy Dorsey,Benny Goodman,Glenn Miller,and all those people,it wasn't a rebellion against anything.I can't remember my parents being upset about it.It wasn't exactly the kind of music that they had enjoyed,but it wasn't,it didn't have that rebellion aspect.But do you feel that the rock music definitely has rebellion and anger as part of it?Yeah,definitely that's the predominant theme in most of it.Do you think,uh,does the sex run all the way through it and all kinds of kooky sex?I'm,I understand that some of these rock music lyrics include homosexuality,sadomasochism,incest,promiscuity,and,and those forms that involve the total degradation of women.Do you find that true?Yeah,definitely got some examples of that?Yeah,I do.On the theme of the,uh,perversion type in it,we have a song by Skid Row,which is called Sweet Little Sister,and the petting it's called the petting's Getting Heavy.Got her tongue in my ear.Her friend is doing time for kicking a blank blank on a queer.May I say that here.Uh,she,she'll get you dancing with the crack of her whip,take you up to heaven in her rocket ship.Her mamma kill her if she knew what she'd do.She'll love you black and blue.She's my little sister.Now,you know,you can see homosexuality,uh,violence and sex,as well as incest there in just one song which hit 18 on the Billboard charts and sold over half a million copies and bad grammar too,yes.Uh,well,do you,do you think that this rock music has a definite and adverse effect on young people?Oh definitely.Matter of fact,um,I'd like to read you something that's a study that was just done that I thought was very interesting.Um,there was 1700 6th through 9th grade students that,uh,there was a survey done on them by the Rhode Island Rape Crisis Center.Now I question the,uh,I don't like the survey being done on those students,but nonetheless,here are the statistics that they came up with.It said that 65% of the boys and 57% of the girls said that it was acceptable for a man to force a woman to have sex if they had been dating for more than 6 months.And it also said a quarter that nearly a quarter of the boys and 1/6 of the girls said it was acceptable for a man to force a woman to have sex if he had spent a lot of money on her.I mean,we're raising a generation of young girls here that feel that they're nothing more than prostitutes.If they get a movie and a dinner that they're obligated to pay back something and you see this very Predominantly in the type of music that they're listening to that has this theme in it,it appears to have the same effect as pornography.It alters the relationships and the perceptions of the other sex,and it makes a lot of men who are into it think that a woman is just a thing whom they can use and abuse for their own,for their own purposes.We are going to go to calls after this next break,and we'd like to hear from some people who may have been devotees of rock music.We'd like to hear what you have to say about it and let's pass out that toll-free number from any.In America 1-800-736-3202.So I see you still do have your old Harry James album that you won

**spk_0:** [17:18.69 - 29:09.83] On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and this week,of course,we're talking about rock music,a hot program indeed,and yes,and we've got Shirley Marvin with us who's made a study of this over the last few years,but let's go to a call.OK,let's take Dave in.St.Louis over our flagship station KSIV for Phyllis-Schlafly.Hello Dave.Do you have an experience with rock music you'd like to tell us about?Yeah,I listened to rock music for about 7-8 years and I still listen to some rock music,but There's a lot of bad rock music out there,and I got into was promoting the sex and the drugs,and most of all it was promoting the devil.The devil.Yeah,I used to listen to bands like Slayer and Celtic Frost and Like white pride and candle mask and Other bands like that and they openly tell you in their lyrics and they just tell you,you know,to believe in the devil and trust in him and do the things he wants you to do.How many hours a week do you think you listen to rock music?I used to listen to rock music.Or how many hours a day?I used to listen to about 4 or 5 hours a day,every day,4 or 5 hours a day,every day.And what kind of effect did these lyrics have on you?Well,whenever you felt like going along with the waves of the devil,the,the lyrics boosted you up to go along with it.But whenever you felt like there was something going on there and something that wasn't right,it drug you down.And they,the lyrics were definitely promoting Satanism,the occult,the weird behavior.Yeah,they're definitely promoting it.Tell you it's cool to do it,tell you you ought to do it,and it's the way you should be,and that there's no other right way.And you,you started to believe all that.I believed in it for a long time.How'd you get out of it?Through God?Oh,tell us more about that.First of all,was the listening to the rock music and listening to these lyrics,do you agree that that's an addiction,like an addiction to drugs?Oh yes,it's an addiction because sometimes whenever like my car stereo went out a couple of years ago and what,what was that a car stereo I had cassette player in my car,your car stereo,it blew up or something.It started to not work a couple of years ago and did you have withdrawal pains?I was very angry at it and I was dying to find a stereo just to play the stuff on and it was like I went,I was supposed to be going somewhere.I went home and I started just listening to it more.I just went home to listen to it.Oh,and then it was when you found God or became a Christian that you were able to get this out of your life.Was that,was that hard?Was that hard to do?Well,at some points in time I thought it was,but It's not really hard to do at all.All you have to do is trust in God.He'll deliver you,and you're glad you're rid of it.I'm very glad I'm rid of it.Well,do you,do you feel that the beat and the noise level of the rock music is an important part of it,just as important as the lyrics?Yeah,the beat and the noise level,it's like somehow or another,um,it.promotes it and it pushes it off in some subliminal way to push into your brain and although consciously,like open-mindedly,you think it's cool.Or you might even think it's uncool,but you know,whatever thoughts you have there,it's going deeper into your brain just by different ways that they're pushing it off.And then these lyrics and sounds would come back into your consciousness at other times when you were not even listening to the rock music.Is that correct?Yeah,all the time.And I mean,even after I was born again,sometimes,you know,I'd have just like reoccurrences of that.I mean.I'd be sitting at work and listening to something.I'd turned the radio off for a little while,and I'd hear like tunes from Slayer coming back into my head and tunes from Candlemass or Hades or something like that coming back into my head.And you know,for a few days there,you know,it seemed like not real important,you know,it seemed like not to affect me,but then all of a sudden I started getting this urge that I wanted to listen to it,but I knew it was wrong.Do you think there's any good rock music,or is it all there's good rock music.I was turned on a little while back to some really good bands.They're heavy metal,but they're they're Christian.One of them that I like the most is a band called Deliverance.Because they,all they do and all the songs I've heard of them is they call glory to the name of God,and There's nothing wrong with that.That's the best thing a band can do.But it's got the beat and and the noise of the rock music.It just has good lyrics.Is that it?Yeah.All right,well,we appreciate your call very much,Dave.Thanks for sharing your experiences with us.Phyllis.Representative Gene Dixon of Springfield,Illinois has been listening to this conversation and would like to talk to you now.Hello,Representative Dixon.Hello,Phyllis,how are you?Thank you for joining us today.Well,thank you.It's my privilege.Have you been monitoring this issue?Absolutely.Of course,last year in Missouri legislature here I introduced 31,which was to call for the labeling of any such that advocated drugs,the use of drugs or alcohol,homosexuality,any type of sexual promiscuity,deviant sexuality.Murder,suicide,sadomasochism,and all of those things,and we worked diligently on that bill all last year.Well,did you arouse the opposition of the liberals who think you ought to be able to say anything anytime to anybody?Oh,of course,the first one to step forward was the ACLU.who wanted to censor this kind of thing and quoting it unconstitutional because of rights of First Amendment speech.Well,don't you believe in truth in packaging and in labeling?Of course I do,but I do believe that obscenity,which we're dealing with here.Uh,is not protected under the First Amendment.That's correct.And also the movies have a rating system,don't they?Well,why shouldn't the rock music have a,have a rating system?Well,they certainly should,Phyllis.I,of course,ended up calling it my,uh,consumer protection bill because everything today is labeled.By law they label all types of food and drugs and cosmetics,etc.and nobody calls that an interference with your First Amendment rights.Absolutely not.Yet they they scream because we want.To warn parents and young people about the things that they are putting into their mind.Did your bill pass?Uh,not yet,Phyllis.It didn't,uh,we,of course,down to 3 days before the session ended,we thought we would get something through.One of the senators here in the state,helped me and Uh,we did get a civil cause of action,which was excellent.We're coming back with it next year,uh,full force,and,uh,that's some interesting things about that I'd like to share with you.But,uh,one of the senators did attach a,uh,civil cause of action to our slasher video bill,and what this called for was,uh,saying that damages could be maintained by a person who is injured or by other persons who acted as a result of motivation derived from such audio recordings.And also saying that they would be able to hold the producers or the performers of this type of music responsible in the case of wrongful death,which could be a suicide or in many cases like the case in Minnesota where this young man came out and punked his hair out because of a dispute with his father over a cassette tape of hard metal,heavy metal music cassette tape that he wanted to listen to,and turned around and axed to death his entire family.Oh terrible.Well,that's like the old ram Shop Act which held the tavern dealer liable for what the drunk did when he walked out of the saloon and killed other people.We,we had a bill like that in the Illinois legislature,uh,not to do with music or the videos,but to do with just ordinary pornography,and I think it passed in in the in this year.Session.So that is a great way to go.Is that correct?Well,I know,uh,you know,the,uh,PMRC has worked on this a great deal.That's the Parents Music Resource Center.Are you familiar with the film that they have called Rising to the Challenge?No,I'm not.Tell us about it.Phyllis.It's excellent,and it,I think,uh,that Shirley Marvin,uh,uh,may have touched on a lot of the contents of that film,but Uh,I know when,uh,someone gave that to me,a police officer,a friend of mine gave that to me,and I brought it home and watched it.I was absolutely appalled by the graphic sexuality and promotion of Satanism,uh,that is,uh,done through this,uh,rock music,and I commend this young man who called in.Uh,and talked about how he got out of rock music.Uh,that's quite a testimony,and,uh,that was interesting,wasn't it?Yes,it's very interesting,and he is absolutely right,and I wish so many times that people would just stop and look at the,the incidences,the cases,the documentation of young people across this nation who have either taken their life,and I could just,I could read you 100 of them right now,Phyllis,who have either taken their own life or they have taken their life of their family or a family member.Uh,we just had a case right in,uh,Columbia Columbia where a young boy took his,uh,stepsister's life and the,the,uh,prosecuting attorney wanted to use the,uh,uh,the notebooks within which this boy had lots and just hundreds of,uh,of,uh,lyrics,uh,written down and,uh,uh,Satanistic symbols and all of this type of stuff,and so far as I understand it they've not been able to use that.Well,we have Shirley Marvin here at this microphone,and I'm sure she's been helping you on your bill.Sure a great lady.Shirley,you're gonna go back and help on that bill,aren't you?Yes,I definitely am.Uh,we're really optimistic about this legislation.We have Gene Dixon,Jeff City that's really working hard on this in the House,and we also have the senator that Jeane referred to.Who is a has a very personal interest on this issue and that is that his secretary was the mother of one of the boys that made national news from Carthage,Missouri for clubbing their,uh,best friend with a baseball bat to death,and they did it,uh,through messages and ideas they got from the rock music and that also was a case where they tried to use that in the defense of it.Uh,in the courts it was not successful in that,and,uh,but the,the senator obviously is very,uh,concerned about this issue because he has firsthand experience with the results of it.It would seem to me that,uh,it would help your bill greatly to give some of these specific examples and also to give printed copies of the lyrics of these songs which are so obnoxious and so offensive.Uh,well,uh,Gene Dixon,we appreciate it.You are from,uh,Columbia,Missouri,is that where,uh,Phyllis,I'm from Springfield Springfield,Missouri.That's correct.And,uh,11 exciting note I would like to say that,uh,through a conference,several of them that I've attended over the summer,uh,right now it looks like we have about 30 states that are going to go with this legislation this next year,uh,across the nation.trying to put forth mandatory labeling.Well,we wish you well on your legislation,and we hope other people in other states will follow your example.Thank you for joining us today.Stay with us.Exciting conversation and informative conversation about rock music on the USA Radio Network.We will return.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [30:27.22 - 40:33.44] From the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we're talking about rock music this week.Of course,your telephone calls are welcome.Plenty of room for you at 1-800-736-3202.Are you ready to go across and see who we've got for you,Phyllis?Yes,we are.Our engineer has just told me that the telephone company has installed new telephones in this area.And that may account for a little hiss on this program.It's not our fault,but bear with us.We hope the phone company will have a cleaner line for us next week.Let's move to Waterloo,Illinois.Here's Becky for Phyllis Schlaffly and,uh,Shirley Marvin.Hello Becky.What is your question or comment?Yes,I have a question.Um,this past week my daughter started her first year in high school here in town.And she took an art course and in that class,the teacher told the students on the first day that they would have some days that they would listen to rock music,one of the local popular stations in St.Louis,because the teacher said that was her personal preference.Well,of course I objected and I did speak with the principal,and he said that in that class and at lunch hour and on in the honor study hall it's considered an incentive to the students to allow rock music so um I have a letter written to the superintendent and the principal,but I would like to know where I could get documented facts or literature to send with my letter.Uh,if you will write to us,we will have a packet on rock music that will have some information that you would be able to use.Uh,I have heard of this in a number of places where they played rock music in the lunch hour and parents have been able to get it removed,and I hope you will too,but did you say they were going to play it in the class?Well,what are we paying the teacher for?We're paying the teacher to teach a class,aren't we?Oh well I think that's really outrageous and if you don't get satisfaction from the teacher or the principal,I think you should take it to the superintendent and take it to the members of the school board.And uh and then uh find a different class for your child.I've already done that.That's taken care of already.Well,thank you for letting us know about it,and you will be able to get a packet from us with some information that I believe will be helpful.Phyllis and Shirley.Here's Mike in Saint Louis.Hello,Mike.Phyllis.What is your question or comment?Um,I just want to tell you that,um,at one time I was into uh heavy metal really heavily.And I was in the satanic medal.Uh,but,uh,uh,um,and I got a,uh,and I got a brother that is still into it very heavily.And he's 21 and see,I'm a Christian now.I just got off about last year.And for Uh,he's into it so much,that,uh,he's,he's,he's changed,you know,uh.No,no,no,I don't know.You tell me how he changed.Well,he's,he's gotten more violent.Uh,he,he writes,he,he writes violent lyrics.Uh,he,he plays in the heavy metal band.For the benefit of our listeners who don't know,please tell us what heavy metal is.Well,uh,he listens to a band called Slayer.Uh,matter of fact,he just went out and bought an album called South of Heaven.And uh he told me of a song called Mandatory Suicide that uh that uh he likes very much and I and uh and I and I've been trying to witness to him that he shouldn't listen to that kind of stuff,you know,because it it affects him.Is he your younger brother?Yes,uh,yeah.Well,I think you ought to make that your project to try to reclaim him,to try to give him some maybe some good rock music which I understand is available,uh,and to,uh,give him some good influences and,and to show him what a dead end run it is to get his mind and his emotions tied up with suicidal and violent thoughts.The problem is,but every time I try to,uh,uh.Uh,advise something like,uh,you know,some other kind of music,uh,he only mocks me.Uh,see,I've tried preaching to him and I've gave him scripture written down on paper that,uh,requires the lust and stuff like that,but he just,uh,tosses it in the trash can and,uh,he won't listen to,uh,any words of God at all,and,uh.Uh,it seemed like he's just going straight downhill.Well,uh,of course you can pray for him.Uh,that is pretty hard.Is he still in school or does he have a job?Uh,he's out of school now.Uh,he's 21.Uh,gosh,uh,man,uh,he tells me all these songs that he's been writing,you know,and,uh,just blows me away.Uh,he just wrote a song called The Wrath of the Blade.It's about the return of Jack the Ripper and uh tells about uh killing women and stuff like that.Uh,he's just totally into violence,you know,uh,uh,and he says that uh uh he's old,you know,he's old enough that he can do what he pleases,but,uh.You know,well,he sounds,he sounds like he's going down a violent and a very bad trail.Uh,you should pray for him.You should try to give him substitute,uh,music.Uh,you should try different tactics,uh,maybe,maybe a little bit of ridicule,uh,maybe trying to find another adult who could give him some advice,but please work on it because your brother sounds like he needs help.He does and it apparently,uh,you have confirmed.Doctor Bettelheim said that it really is an addiction that is hard to get out of hard to get out.Let's see if Shirley has some comment on this.Well,I find what you're saying is what you hear over and over again and very similar to the idea of the addiction where they say the main symptom of that is denial.Uh,the hardest thing you have to deal with here is that your brother is going to deny over and over that the music is harming him as a drug addict or an alcoholic would.Uh,you need to deal with that and convince him whatever level you can,uh,with him either psychologically or,uh,challenging him.Uh,it is to show him that the effect of this is harmful to him,and he will continue to deny that except through a lot of prayer and convincing.Well,thank you.Very much for calling,Mike.We'll go to the next caller and we'll hope you have good luck.Here's Shane in Saint Charles.Hello,Shane.Hi,how are you?What's your comment on this subject?Well,um,we have an organization called National Information Network,and we basically do research on these type of areas.And,uh,Shirley had made comment earlier in the program about,uh,the frequency ranges and the subconscious mind or the influence of the lyrics and,uh,one of the things I'd like to do is maybe quote a couple of the document resources that we have in that area and I think the listeners will begin to understand why this is a,an,an addiction,uh,just as the research has indicated in the past.Well,I,I wish you would quote that.I once was a chaperone at a high school dance,and,and I had a headache for a week after from the volume of noise,right?Well,uh,Randy Doika,who was a one-time head sound man for Black Sabbath,You're He,Pink Floyd,you know,Aerosmith,those groups.Uh,he was ordered directly by these groups to play 3 different soundtracks just prior to the opening of their concerts,and the 1st 2 had audible sounds.The third audible track,uh,was not audible to the ears.It was,uh,with no audible sounds,with only frequency ranges of 20,000 hertz and above.And the reason for this was to make a blatant attempt to hype the audience for the,uh,concert.Uh,they're using these frequency ranges which,uh,there's not a lot of documentation out on it,but it deals with the subconscious structure of the human mind,the rhythmatic formulas of the,the music,the frequency ranges being used,and how it can manipulate the human mind as well as the body chemistry to actually create a drug addiction type of effect.Uh,the body begins to develop chemistries.chemicals within the body that crave this rhythmatic formula and this frequency range to continue to release these frequencies and and you mean these high frequency recordings were played at the same time as the music that you heard and you didn't realize it was subliminal,right?That's what's being done now.Another common industry that we're all familiar with is an organization called Muzak.Uh,that's the organization that basically puts out the music we hear in the doctor's office.Well,Rod Baum,uh,the programmer and director for Muzak,uh,made a comment.He said that he selects his songs that influence millions of Americans each day by using special music modes.He engineers subliminal power that will reduce stress at the most hectic times of the day,incite the board,increase job productivity.I use data from controlled tests and biorhythmic charts to help me formulate my masterpieces.Well,I guess if you can select music to reduce stress and make you not worry about having your tooth pulled while you're waiting to see the dentist,you could also have music that will increase stress.And I guess that's what many of us think rock music is,right?And again,the whole thing is you,you have the audible lyric content which obviously is going to influence us just as Adolf Hitler said,if somebody hears something loud enough and long enough,they're eventually going to believe it.Um,so we have that bombardment,but we also have to take into account the rhythmatic formulas they're using,the frequency ranges.They're using the high end as well as the low end.Uh,the low end starts messing with your alpha,beta,delta,and theta brain waves.Well,thank you very much,uh,Shane.We're out of time,but we appreciate your sharing your insight with us.And on Phyllis-Schlafly Live,we're talking about rock music this week.Weekend we're joined by Shirley Marvin.She's made a particular study of rock music and has worked on legislation in the state capital of Missouri in Jefferson City.We're at 1-800-736-3202.Let's hear from you on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [41:40.07 - 50:12.06] from the north to the south we're standing proud.Fields to the black trees will shut the.our Constitution is still standing.Like a beagle soaring high above the clouds.and From the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly live.Welcome back and let's go right back to telephone calls.Here's Janet in Modesto over KCIV.That's in California.Hello Janet.Hello Janet.Are you there,Janet?Yes,can you hear me?Oh yes,yes,we can hear you now.OK.I just have a couple of comments I'd like to make.First,I'd like to confirm what the man just before the break said about all the music and what it does to the chemical makeup of a human.I have a friend that was in a rock group,and he said that they purposely did songs to get people's,uh,he did it at,uh,he,he was a.guitar player with a band,and they used to get people purposely to dance a certain way.And if you watch how they dance,it's kind of vulgar a lot of times it's because the music sets off certain nerves in the body.So I'd like to confirm what he said is true.And second,another lady called and commented about how there was a rock music playing.During the classroom,yes,well,I used to live in Carson City,Nevada,and this little fifteen-year-old in junior high told me that the teacher would assign,make assignments,and then turn the radio on and let them sit there and listen to the radio for the rest of the class time.So it,it's,well,my question is,what are we paying the teacher for?Yeah,I'd like to know that too.It's uh this little 15 year old said that the,the kids curse at the teachers and treat them with no respect and the teacher's hands are tied with what they can do about it,and so they just let the kids do what they want.This is what this little 15 year old told me.Oh,that's,that's completely outrageous.I,I have heard of teachers playing videos during class.I didn't know they played rock music.I think parents,you ought to look into that and find out what's going on in your school.So thank you very much,Janet.We appreciate your call from California.Let's move on to Jacksonville,Florida.WXTL and Peter from Phyllis-Schlafly.Hello,Phyllis,how are you doing?Hello Peter.What is your question or comment?Well,my comment is about what everybody's been talking about in rock music,but there's another analysis that a lot of people don't realize that rock music does have a certain influence on a lot of people.Now,for instance,let me give you an example.Back in 1969 when the Beatles were,you know,still popular and everything.They had an album called The White Album,and there was a couple of,uh,tracks that,ah,if you played it in reverse,you would get a satanic,uh,message.For instance,there was one that,uh,they had on there just a bunch of noises and a guy was saying number 9,number 9,number 9,and stuff like that.When you play the record in reverse,you'd hear the guy say,Turn me on dead man.Turn me on dead man,and it's really a shock to believe that a lot of this rock music,if you do play it in reverse,has these satanic messages.Peter,Peter,I've heard about that for a long time,but I couldn't figure out how to play the record in reverse.How do you do that if your turntable has what they call a neutral.OK,and just,you know,put your little finger on the turntable,and,uh,that means you can move it forward or backwards.And then you start playing it from the very end of the song and then you'll hear all of these messages like there's another one that I heard where a guy was talking about.Getting in playing it in reverse,he would say,get me out of this,get me out of this,and meaning that he was probably asking for help to get him out of some kind of a tragic moment he was in or what have you,but Like I said,I've studied a lot of this for the years,and when I was a kid,I did listen to it,and I didn't know any better,but when you grow up,you know,during the years,you hear these songs again,and then you start to realize that there's something a little bit different than what you heard before when you were a kid.Well,thank you very much,Peter.We'll have to move there's no way to stop this,but if there was a way to stop this,the only thing we can do for our kids is to tell them not to buy it,but they're going to do it anyway.And if there was a way that we can stop them,well,we certainly at least ought to be able to stop it from being played in the schools.So thanks a lot besides that,the videos too,they should outlaw those too because of the.Sexual explicit material that's on there.Well,thanks a lot,Peter,for your comment.We have to move right along to another call.Odessa,Texas.Here's Lonnie over at KKKK.hello,Lonnie in Texas.What is your question or comment?Well,I'd like to thank God for the program you're having today.Uh,I have a ministry now called Vision Ministries,and I thank God for bringing me out of rock and roll and drugs.And uh I was the manager of a rock group and we we were I was just hooked on rock and roll when you were hooked on it,that's been said on this program and you do think it's harmful.It is harmful.And you have a mission to reclaim people who are hooked on rock music.Absolutely.Uh,there was this group that I managed,uh,they're still playing,you know,around Dallas and these big towns.That,well,we wish you well with your mission,Lonnie.We're about out of time.We're going to try to squeeze one more call in before the end into St.Louis,Missouri,and Curtis over KSIV.Hello,Curtis,what is your question or comment?Yes,I am an organist and choir director,retired,and for many years I have played the organ and directed choirs in the St.Louis area.And,uh,I am much opposed to the rock music.Not only the secular,I'm gonna open a can of worms here,but not only to the,uh,secular rock music,but to the Christian rock because I think that this is encouraging our young people,even our Christian young people,telling them it's all right to listen to the rock music.And,uh,a lot of the contemporary music is beautiful and a lot of it is not.I've noticed a big decline.In the choral work because unless the church is heavily involved in the contemporary rock music,uh,very few of the younger people care about and can even mention the beautiful old hymns of the church,and I was just wondering if there's any way.Or any group that's trying to,trying to put a stop and bring back some sanity to our young people.Well,we're trying,we're trying,and we thank you for your insight into this,which you have because of your lifetime of work with music.I wish we had time to talk to you further.I wish we had time to take more calls.We've Enjoyed having Shirley Marvin with us today.If we had more time with her,she'd like to tell you about the relationship of rock music to the slasher movies and how they both have such a very adverse effect on young people.So good luck in your work,Shirley,and thank you for joining us.And on the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [52:18.83 - 53:19.85] President Reagan was always a big supporter of the entertainment industry,but he said something about rock music just before he left the White House that I'll share with you.I don't believe that our founding fathers ever intended to create a nation where the rights of pornographers would take precedence over the rights of parents,and the violent and malevolent would be given free rein to prey upon our children.That's a good statement,so I.Suggest to you parents out there to look at the lyrics of the songs that your children are listening to.It's not the music that is so objectionable.It is what they are saying.And then join us next week when we will be talking about nuclear war courses.Phyllis-Schlafly Live on parents' rights and education presented by the USA Radio Network and by Eagle-Forum,a leading pro-family organization since 1972.Stay informed on what the public schools are teaching our children with Phyllis-Schlafly Live on parents' rights and education.
