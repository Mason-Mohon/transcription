**spk_0:** [00:02.59 - 00:12.75] If you think that global education just means teaching about history and geography,you are in for a shock.Global education means eliminating patriotism.

**spk_1:** [00:14.59 - 01:09.77] Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.I'm Bruce Hayes.Phyllis,a few new stations to announce KERP Pueblo,Colorado,WXTL Jacksonville,Florida,and there's WRVM at Suring,Wisconsin.Well,today we'll be dealing with another one of those trendy fads invading the curriculum of public schools,global education,and of course we want to hear from you.Jot down our toll-free number from anywhere in America,1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.It's not a new subject,but it's a trendy fad indeed.Appears in some form in most schools,in most grade levels,in most teacher workshops,and in most textbooks and teaching materials.If you've had some experience with global education in your schools,please call us at 1-800-736-3202 and tell us about it.

**spk_0:** [01:10.05 - 02:16.40] The average person might think that global education means teaching history,geography.Government,culture,or the language of various nations around the globe,if you think that you are behind the times,those subjects have always been taught as part of world history and geography and foreign languages.A good education ought to include all of those things,but global education is very different.The purpose of global education is not to teach knowledge.And facts.The purpose of global education is to teach school children new attitudes and to brainwash them to accept a particular view of the world,such as particularly that they are world citizens rather than American citizens.Today we're going to talk about global education,and our guest today is Mr.John Stormer of Saint Louis,Missouri,who is the author of one of the best selling conservative books of all time,none dare call it treason.He has spent 20 years in Christian education and is now developing a curriculum for Christian schools called Understanding the Times,

**spk_1:** [02:16.46 - 02:20.18] and John Stormer on the line with us from Saint Louis.Hello John,

**spk_0:** [02:20.70 - 02:37.10] thank you for joining us.Good to be with you.In your review of school curriculum,I'm sure you've looked at plenty of these courses.Do you find that global education is dropped in here and there in various courses with an attempt to affect the,the attitudes of schoolchildren?

**spk_2:** [02:37.99 - 02:45.83] Well,more even than dropped in,it's coming to the place where it almost permeates all the different,uh,uh,areas of the curriculum.

**spk_0:** [02:46.08 - 02:47.41] Give us some examples.

**spk_2:** [02:47.95 - 03:11.66] Well,ah,we can go back,and this isn't something just new,although it's exploding today.Ah,I can remember when I was in school and,uh,when Spain erupted and Japan and China got in the war before World War II,and then when,when Poland,uh,Ah,when Stalin and Hitler,uh,carved up Poland,we were told that in some way it was our fault because we hadn't gone into the League of Nations.

**spk_0:** [03:11.82 - 03:19.78] No,I remember that I was taught that that the cause of World War One,the cause of World War II was that we didn't enter the League of Nations,

**spk_2:** [03:20.06 - 03:37.20] right?And then it was built on,uh,you get into the 1950s,and I have textbooks that,uh,uh,for example,tell us that,uh,A History of America by Southsworth published in 1951.Uh,shows,uh,United Nations troops going ashore on D-Day,uh,in Europe.

**spk_0:** [03:37.36 - 03:39.82] Funny thing,I thought they were American troops.Well,

**spk_2:** [03:39.88 - 03:54.04] and the United Nations wasn't even formed till a year later,but a generation of Americans have been given the idea that some way the UN,uh,saved us from Hitler and Tocho and all those terrible things.So there's been a conditioning over the years.

**spk_0:** [03:54.77 - 04:02.71] Ah,the UN couldn't even save Major Higgins.Uh,you know,he was on a UN mission over there in Lebanon,and the UN didn't do a thing to help him.

**spk_2:** [04:03.21 - 04:52.87] But,uh,this thing seemed to have exploded then,uh,following an agreement that,uh,uh,George Shultz,our Secretary of State,Chevernadze,the,uh,Soviet foreign minister,made at Geneva in,uh,November of 1985.Uh,relating to cultural exchanges and cooperation and scientific,technical,and educational fields,and,uh,uh,there was a,uh,coming out of that,uh,treaty that we signed,there was a,uh,uh,citizens summit held in February of 1987,and they came up with about 300 different projects on which they created task.Force and uh I'll just go through a little list of uh this was in the Soviet American news,it's the projects of the Soviet American Council for Joint Projects.

**spk_0:** [04:52.97 - 04:55.35] Is this a publication of the USSR?Right?

**spk_2:** [04:56.49 - 04:56.52] OK,

**spk_0:** [04:56.58 - 04:57.08] go ahead.

**spk_2:** [04:58.41 - 05:02.87] They're going to jointly develop a high school world citizenship course,

**spk_0:** [05:03.45 - 05:05.34] for use in American schools,right.

**spk_2:** [05:06.30 - 05:54.42] Ah,there's a clearing house been established for Soviet American education.Ah,there's a new international peace organization for children,uh,educator exchanges,where we're sending teachers back and forth,uh,well,uh,here in Saint Louis,uh.Uh,Saint Louis University High School was one of about 30 schools that got involved,uh,this past year for the first time with,uh,exchanging students between the two schools,and before the Soviets sent their students over here,they had two of their teachers came and helped the,uh,Saint Louis University High School,uh,develop their curriculum,uh.Ah,the previous semester,so I guess there'd be nothing that would interfere or poison the Soviets.

**spk_0:** [05:54.64 - 06:30.78] Well,I don't know what the Soviets could possibly teach us about their whole idea of education is brainwashing for the total communist state.Do you think these exchanges and the things you've been telling us contribute to what Ambassador Jean Kirkpatrick has called the myth of equivalence,this notion that's propagated everywhere and particularly by the global ed people,that the United States and the Soviet Union are roughly equivalent,that is morally,politically,economically,or whatever,and they just have a different point of view,and we have to be very tolerant in a pluralistic world.

**spk_2:** [06:31.66 - 06:46.30] Bombarded with that sort of thing when,uh,the students were massacred in Tiananmen Square,uh,I heard newsmen telling us that,well,they had their Tiananmen Square and we had our Kent State and therefore,uh,we shouldn't get too upset with them.

**spk_0:** [06:46.78 - 07:16.32] It's a,it's an idea to make us be uh be tolerant of other points of view.Now it is an objective fact that we have tremendously more freedom of all kinds in the United States and our economic system has built,uh,prosperity and a standard of living,uh,that's the envy of the world.Uh,the students aren't taught that though.Global Ed is designed to,uh,make them believe that that isn't so.Do you find some samples of that in the work that you've done?

**spk_2:** [07:16.81 - 07:42.47] Ah,yes,I think for example of,uh,one,Grade school,ah,ah,geography book,ah,and I can't put my finger just on the name of it right now,but it talked about,ah,ah,the Soviets find,ah,the land of opportunity to be Siberia just like,ah,our early pioneers found the go west,young man.

**spk_0:** [07:42.77 - 07:49.53] Well,that was what Vice President Henry Wallace said when he came back from his trip to the Soviet Union,a long time ago.

**spk_2:** [07:49.73 - 07:51.79] Well,it's now in some of the textbooks.

**spk_0:** [07:52.73 - 08:19.37] Well,going back to the designs of global education and what you mentioned about the cause of World War II,it's pretty clear now that the cause of World War II was a disarmament race that the West disarmed in the face of the growing military power of Nazi Germany.And the global ed people seem to sweep that under the rug and make us think that it's an arms race that causes war.

**spk_2:** [08:19.66 - 08:33.59] Well,they,they would have us believe that,plus the fact that there's this constant idea that,that we can solve or resolve world tensions through treaties and agreements with totalitarians and people who've never kept their word.

**spk_0:** [08:34.64 - 09:17.83] One of the objectives of global education it seems to me is to inculcate school children with the notion of the scarcity of natural resources,and that leads inevitably to saying we should have an international authority that parcels them out.In other words,it's a device for making the United States give up the wealth that the private enterprise system has produced and,uh,share it with the rest of the world.Um,have you found some examples of that,or,uh,in,in the,um,uh,curricula that you have looked at?It's this notion of economic interdependence with everybody.They want to sell interdependence instead of independence.

**spk_2:** [09:18.59 - 10:52.78] Well,I can think of,uh,again,a,a,a,a very old book,uh,MacGruder's American Government,which,uh,many of our listeners probably would recognize that they,they,uh,got their American supposedly American government instruction over a 30 year period,uh.And in one of the additions,uh,uh,after pointing out that,uh,uh,because the unity of our own states brought peace and strength to our country,similar cooperation will bring peace and goodwill to the nations of the world.They,of course,uh,uh,then they say when we have definite international laws and an army to enforce them,we'll have international peace.Well,of course they ignore the fact that our 13 colonies had a common language,a common heritage,a common belief in God,and all those things that don't exist in the world.Ah,and after telling the student in the final chapter,every thoughtful person looks to the United Nations as the best instrument for peace and world security,and who wouldn't want to be thoughtful,ah,then they,they,uh,lay out for the student to work for,and it's exactly what you,you mentioned,international commerce should be regulated,uh,control of the resources and so forth,and then,uh,an international police controlling all.The,the arms and so forth and,and the next step then,uh,but when can we afford to pay taxes for support of an international organization,the students asked.Well,if an international police force can maintain peace,the member countries could save many times the cost of such an organization and therefore we could pay our income taxes to this world organization.

**spk_0:** [10:53.59 - 11:26.07] Well,John,you,you and I can remember after World War II,we were told that the United Nations was the last best hope for peace,and it became a kind of a secular religion with a lot of people.If you attacked the UN,you were really thought to be somebody who It was just beyond the pale.You were a primitive.You were not educated.You weren't future looking,and so forth.But I think the UN has had its day.I just don't think they can sell the United Nations anymore.It's such a failure on every front.What do you,

**spk_2:** [11:26.14 - 11:51.62] I believe that we'll probably see,and I see woven into much of the curriculum and much of the other propaganda.Ah,that we'll have to go beyond the UN and have some sort of merger,uh,because,uh,we haven't given up our sovereignty and some of these others haven't given up their sovereignty.The UN really hasn't worked and we're going to have to move beyond that into some sort of a Well,

**spk_0:** [11:57.57 - 12:16.57] we'll see if even the Europeans can get together.Ah,Margaret Thatcher and the British don't seem to want to join in the European Community,and if even they can't get together,it's simply unlikely that the United States could get together with all of these other languages with the,the other people with different languages and traditions and styles of government and so forth.

**spk_2:** [12:17.14 - 12:50.76] Well,if we,if we get into a situation,uh,let's say that,uh,uh,You know,prosperity never goes on forever,and,uh,we get into an economic crisis here and face some of the deficits and all the rest,and,and,uh,it gets worldwide,and,and the American people are sold on the idea that,uh,uh,some structural change in our government,a new constitution,and,uh,merging into some of these systems and I can remember that we went into the United Nations and I think there was only one dissenting vote and they had what,an hour's debate.

**spk_0:** [12:51.17 - 13:12.05] It was,uh,well,you just had to join it even though Alger Hiss was the first Secretary General of the of the United Nations.Well,they never could.Convince people like you and me who can remember World War II,but if they teach global education in the schools and children don't know any history,they may have a different constituency to deal with in future years.

**spk_2:** [13:12.13 - 13:23.69] The point we have to remember,I have some contact in Korea,and one of the very real problems there today is the fact that 80% of the Koreans have been born since the war,

**spk_0:** [13:24.17 - 13:41.90] and they don't remember.You mean the Korean War.Oh yes,well,thank you very much for joining us today,John.We'll have to get you back another time and have you tell us all about your new curriculum called Understanding the Times.I think that's something that the Christian schools can look forward to.When do you expect to have it completed?

**spk_2:** [13:42.15 - 13:48.62] We'll have several schools on a pilot basis this year,and it'll be available full scale for the 1990 school year.

**spk_0:** [13:48.87 - 13:58.57] All right,if anybody wants to contact us,uh,you can write to Radio Live with P Phyllis-Schlafly,and we'll forward your letter to John Stormer.Thank you for joining us today.Good to

**spk_1:** [13:58.57 - 14:25.95] be with you,John Stormer from St.Louis on Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we'll be going to your telephone calls.So jot down our toll-free number.We can reach us from anywhere in America at 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.Now we're talking about global education,whether you agree or disagree,uh,we'd like to hear from you.Stay with us.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_3:** [14:41.85 - 16:08.10] Too many children have been cheated out of the education they deserve.Did you know that nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science?That's a problem we can no longer afford to ignore.Educational excellence in the public school starts with respect for the rights of students,parents,and taxpayers.But what are they?Every student has the right to be taught to read the English language in the first grade.Every student has the right to family privacy,the right to his religious faith and beliefs,the right to share information with his parents.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy from Eagle-Forum.Learn more about the rights you and your children should expect.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy by writing Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.From the east to the west we're standing proud from the north to the south we're standing proud.Like trees.Constitution is still standing.Kept us strong.

**spk_2:** [16:08.85 - 16:09.35] It's been

**spk_1:** [16:38.63 - 16:57.04] From the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Phyllis,before we jump into our telephone calls at 1-800-736-3202.A quick question Are the global ed people what I would call maybe upfront about what they're after,or do they disguise their goals?

**spk_0:** [16:57.12 - 17:36.19] Oh,they really disguise it.In fact,they are taught to infuse their ideas into the curriculum.And a couple of years ago out in Seattle there was a Rockefeller funded project in which they put out a memo saying global education is an extreme political hot potato,and it said they shouldn't call themselves global educators.They should,they should call it multicultural international curriculum development.Now that would throw most parents off the track.They wouldn't have the slightest idea of what they're talking about.But we're talking about global education today.Let's see if we have any callers.

**spk_1:** [17:36.43 - 17:40.93] Let's go to Anne in Roanoke Rapids,North Carolina.Hello,

**spk_0:** [17:41.18 - 17:44.95] how are you?Hello,Anne.What is your question or comment?Yes,

**spk_4:** [17:45.07 - 18:16.83] well,we do have global education in North Carolina.It is being referred to as interdependence,but we know the term is being used interchangeably.And when we discovered the curriculum,there was about 6000 pages that covered kindergarten through the 12th grade and all of the subject matter,and we began to read the curriculum,and we could see that infusion of the global education,the world government curriculum.Uh,ideas throughout the whole curriculum from kindergarten through 12th grade.Well,

**spk_0:** [18:17.06 - 18:18.01] tell us some examples.

**spk_4:** [18:18.27 - 19:19.10] OK,just a few of the examples.In the 2nd grade,the children were asked to salute the flag and say the Pledge of Allegiance,and then just one day in the 3rd grade.And they were the only two times in the 13 years of the child's life that they even referred to saluting the flag and saying the Pledge of Allegiance,so we saw that the patriotism had been removed.There was a great deal of censorship,and then very next activity was to paraphrase the Pledge of Allegiance,and in 13 years of the child's life there was never any indication that they would return to the original document anymore.And then as we interwove from subject matter to grade level,they were designing postage stamps for worldwide use.They were making new flags for worldwide.Use they were writing a new constitution for a perfect society by the 9th grade,and the words collectively and compromise for the good of the group were throughout the curriculum.

**spk_0:** [19:19.26 - 19:23.34] Did you think they were selling world citizenship or global citizenship?Oh,

**spk_4:** [19:23.38 - 19:53.71] absolutely.There was no doubt about it.After we exposed the curriculum,we went before legislators.I went to the governor.And we began to expose exactly what was in the curriculum,and much of it was rewritten,but for that one theme on interdependence.They have never added any more,uh,activities to salute the flag and say the Pledge of Allegiance,so that seems to be a determination.That the national sovereignty theme and patriotism is to be removed from this curriculum.Now you're

**spk_0:** [19:53.71 - 20:00.28] saying that they pledge allegiance to the flag and recited that only 1 day out of 13 years.It's not one day.No,

**spk_4:** [20:00.36 - 20:04.78] it's 1 day in the 2nd grade and 1 day in the 3rd grade.It's 2 times in the child's life,

**spk_0:** [20:04.84 - 20:12.59] and the rest of the time they're talking about world citizenship and trying to devise some mythical international government that's better.Well,

**spk_4:** [20:13.43 - 20:43.03] they asked the children to role play the United Nations in session when they had problems.Uh,of course they had the guided imagery in there.They even had rock music that the children would be assigned to listen to rock music and,uh,discuss that in the classroom.In fact,we found over 80 times in grades 9 through 12 that the children were assigned to watch television,including soap operas.And through the third grade they had not even been taught to read according to what we could find.

**spk_0:** [20:43.13 - 20:46.90] Well,now,was this curriculum put into the North Carolina schools or did you stop it?

**spk_4:** [20:47.01 - 21:27.51] Well,we kept it out of the schools.This was written in 1985 when the school reform bills were being passed throughout the whole United States.There was state after state working on the school reform bill.And we kept it out of the schools while they were having to appear before the state board of education and other groups to,you know,explain what they had done and having to rewrite it.They actually had to rewrite much of the curriculum.While they,uh,you know,kept it out of the schools for that one year,now it's in loose leaf form and we have found out that they are changing it from day to day or from week to week,and we're not real sure from one day to the next what is going to be in that curriculum,

**spk_0:** [21:27.73 - 21:30.57] so you don't really know whether it's in the schools nobody

**spk_4:** [21:30.57 - 21:41.46] will know because when that curriculum is in loose leaf form,I don't care what state it's in.They will not know overnight what's in that curriculum.We had been told it was put in computer ready for the classroom.

**spk_0:** [21:41.76 - 21:49.86] Well,now tell me,when you kept it out the first year,did you have a parents group?Did you organize?Did you go testify at hearings?Did you,did you lobby the

**spk_4:** [21:49.86 - 22:20.42] governor?We went before the legislators in public hearings.I had gone to the governor privately.He went before the.State Board of Education for me then and he said your curriculum is unacceptable and it was the first time in history that any governor had interceded for anybody like that so we were successful.He even asked the state textbook commission to add phonics textbooks to the list of books available for the schools.We didn't.Even have a state approved textbook that taught phonics at that time,

**spk_0:** [22:20.78 - 22:26.82] but you did have this global citizenship.All right,now what are you doing now to keep it out of the schools?It's very difficult to

**spk_4:** [22:26.82 - 22:59.96] monitor the curriculum every day across the state.We're going to the regional centers.We're also involved in the state board of education.We go to all those meetings monthly and we're going to the library.And we are monitoring the changes as much as possible and we're keeping track of any other new curricular ideas that are added,such as the AIDS curriculum has been added to it now for 7th grade and also religion in the schools is coming in,so we're keeping a close track of that because that would be integrated into that basic education program.

**spk_0:** [23:00.59 - 23:10.47] Well,we wish you well in all of these activities.It certainly makes it very difficult for parents if it's only in loose leaf form.Uh,it's not like a textbook that parents that's

**spk_4:** [23:10.47 - 23:26.77] going to be the problem if it's in computer,parents won't have any access to it.Teachers won't even see from grade to grade what it is.They will see just their own classroom for the most part.or their own course and that's why it's difficult for teachers to even see the magnitude of this whole problem.

**spk_0:** [23:28.53 - 23:31.75] Well,it should be available to all parents as a matter of freedom of information,so we wish

**spk_4:** [23:31.75 - 23:37.47] you well and we are encouraging parents groups all over the state to keep track of what's being taught.

**spk_0:** [23:37.71 - 23:40.83] Well,you keep us posted on what you're doing on Global Ed.Thank you,Anne.

**spk_4:** [23:41.54 - 23:44.57] and I appreciate you letting me speak on this.All right,thanks for covering.

**spk_0:** [23:45.67 - 23:47.39] Thanks,Anne.And in Saint

**spk_1:** [23:47.39 - 23:54.98] Louis,Christian Information is KSIV.Phyllis,a couple of the calls lined up from the Gateway City.Let's check in with Dave for Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [23:55.06 - 23:57.75] Hello Dave,what is your question or comment?Well,

**spk_2:** [23:57.82 - 24:27.96] my comment is I've taught social studies at all levels for many years,and what is most significant is what is not mentioned.For example,they talk about a population explosion and they fail to overlook the fact that North America is much more populous than South America,and yet,uh,South America is much poorer,and the same with Western Europe,it's much more heavily populated than Africa and yet Africa's the one having the famines.They nowhere mention that famines or anything else like that might be the,the caused by the type of government they have.

**spk_0:** [24:28.78 - 25:01.60] Oh,that's a very important point.My study of global ed teaches me that one of the main ideas or attitudes they try to put over in global ed is that there's not enough food to go around and that therefore we have to control the population,limit the population,in addition to having some international body allocate the resources,and it's all false.Some of the most densely populated places in the whole world are the most prosperous,like Hong Kong,like Belgium.And uh thank you for bringing that out.Well,

**spk_2:** [25:01.67 - 25:57.94] one other thing,they never talk about when they talk about problems,they talk about starvation,which is terrible in Africa and other areas,but they never for once,for example,talk about in the 1920s and 1930s when Stalin deliberately starved to death about 10 million peasants in Russia.They never talk about China,where nearly 60 million people have been killed since World War II.Uh,they never talk about any of that.They never talk about the fact that,uh,what Castro has done in Cuba,a country that was one time very self-supporting.In other words,it's not only what is mentioned,it's what is not mentioned.And there's also a book that was put out in 1983 by Paul Vitz,V I T Z.He,uh,studied all kinds of social studies,texts,and Anyone reading that,uh,after reading that,and after the quotes he made,can doubt that there's any bias in it.And the problem that we teachers have is if you try to present both sides of the question,you're in serious danger of losing your job,and,uh,I know from personal experience and So you have to,one of the reasons teachers,

**spk_0:** [25:59.34 - 26:05.19] Dave,is that because they say you have to teach what is in the material that is given you and you can't add,add anything else?

**spk_2:** [26:05.31 - 26:31.85] You cannot add anything else.If you,for example,if you do,you must do it so carefully and water it down so much that it escapes notice because it simply cannot be,uh,most,uh,it,it's very dangerous for a teacher.I,I've known of teachers to actually get fired,of teachers of many years' experience.And it's an extremely dangerous thing to do,and teachers,frankly are afraid.They have families to support and they have to maintain themselves,and they're actually scared,um,um.

**spk_0:** [26:32.37 - 26:46.09] Well,I agree with you that one of the,uh,one of the worst things about some of these bad curricula is,uh,what they don't say and people don't see what is omitted from the course.So thank you very much for,uh,Dave,for giving us this insight.

**spk_1:** [26:46.37 - 26:48.37] And now here's.in St.Louis,

**spk_0:** [26:48.89 - 27:50.30] hello Francis,what is your question or comment?I just wanted to say that I've been a supporter of the global education because I think our young people are idealistic and they're very concerned about the world and our,our environment,but I also agree with you that there are some excesses or absences in this global movement,and,uh,I really feel like I,uh,speak with a fairly good database because I've read most of the CTIR materials.Now they're the,um,from the University of Denver.It's called Center for Teaching International Relations.That's the CTIR,and they're really the biggest purveyors of the,uh,global ed materials,and,uh,you like them.Do you like them?Well,um,I'm,I'm really kind of disappointed,you know,I've read them all,and,and as I kept reading volume after volume,I kept thinking,well,when are they going to present the other side,you know did you ever,did you ever get to it?Never did.Uh,Francis,would you hang on?We have to break for announcements,but we'd like to come back and hear more from you after them.

**spk_1:** [27:50.68 - 28:05.34] Well,if we've touched you in some way with this subject on global education,we'd appreciate hearing from you at 1-800-736-3202.Exciting conversation to come on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.We'll be back,so stay tuned to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_1:** [29:12.07 - 29:22.78] Global education this week on Phyllis-Schlafly Live and we've got a lot of calls,so let's jump right back into it,Phyllis,at 1-800-736-3202.We're talking with Francis.Yes,

**spk_0:** [29:22.90 - 32:04.76] we want to go right back to Francis.You had an additional comment,I think.Well,one of the things that they said in the text that I was reading from CTIR was that,uh,they made the comment for the United States,the whole world is a toilet.You know,they,uh,they're so very critical of the United States,and most of all,it wasn't that they were just explicitly critical.It's,it's what they left out.You're left with a feeling that the United States,if we would just stop our plundering of the world's resources and solve the world's hunger problems,that then we could have peace.Well,the United States solved the hunger problem for our people.Uh,we're practically the only people in the history of the world who've never had a famine.Ah,the way to solve the hunger problem is to have economic freedom,and this notion that,ah,that we should feed the rest of the world who are really kept poor because they have socialist governments,ah,doesn't make sense.Ah,they would even,even if we fed them all this year,they would be poor and starving again next year because they have a government that prevents,ah,food from growing and enough food for the people.I noticed in,ah,in,ah,Latvia just this week,ah,where they took all the,the,uh,farmers and the privately owned land away when the Russians took over that country many years ago,ah,they're now so poor they've decided to come back and let some of the Latvian people homestead on the soil in order that,ah,private farmers can make things grow.Freedom produces abundance.That's right,I agree with you and the global education people don't tell us.They,they want to have an international,uh,uh,authority of some kind,uh,to divide up the resources that we have.Well,that's one of the things that disturbed me that there is a new agreement through the UN.That it's a minerals agreement and they are you talking about the law of the sea?Yes,and they're going to,to,uh,put all of the minerals under the control of an international authority and,uh,we'd be severely strapped and we don't have any,uh,of our own source of chromium.It costs a great deal to get some of these minerals and resources out of the ground,and it takes American tech technology and investment to do it.Uh,we shouldn't allow other people to steal it away from us.Well,thanks so much for calling,Francis.Uh,we'll go along to the next caller because we have so many calls waiting.Let me say during the break we had several calls of people who would.I'd like to contact Dave,who called in earlier.We don't know who Dave is.If he would like to provide us with his name and address,we will put those persons in contact with him.Phyllis,

**spk_1:** [32:04.81 - 32:06.97] here's Kay in Shreveport,Louisiana.

**spk_0:** [32:07.07 - 32:10.05] Hello,Kay,what is your question or comment?Well,I just

**spk_6:** [32:10.05 - 32:19.47] have a comment.I don't know that too many parents understand what their children are getting in a course called environmental science.

**spk_0:** [32:19.93 - 32:24.17] I don't,I didn't,I didn't know that was a science.Is this a new science we haven't heard of?

**spk_6:** [32:24.42 - 33:15.89] We didn't either in Louisiana until we found out why this was being offered in the high schools,and we discovered that the,the course curriculums or the credits needed to pass was,uh,raised from 1 to 3 in Louisiana to try to differ the,the regulations.Uh,in order to pass out of high school,but they found that many of these students could not pass general science and biology and chemistry,so they had to come up with a new science course,and they called it environmental science,and the books that were offered for adoption in this particular area,uh,were basically as we,as we began to.Look at the books for nothing more than than what we that is termed global science,and many of the principles and many of the thoughts expressed in these books are the same things that you've been talking about today under the heading of science.

**spk_0:** [33:17.62 - 33:24.03] You,you mean specifically about the scarcity of natural resources and about the need for population control.

**spk_6:** [33:25.59 - 33:29.43] Yes,I,I,I'm sorry,I can barely hear you,but I,I think you said something about.

**spk_0:** [33:29.51 - 33:42.47] Yes,I did this course in environmental science,ah,propagate the notions about,um,about the scarcity of natural resources and about the need for population control.Oh,

**spk_6:** [33:42.55 - 33:50.33] it's,it's full of these types of theories.One of the,the one,ideas that they talk about here is the deathy child.

**spk_0:** [33:50.49 - 33:52.44] Example,I didn't understand you.The what?

**spk_6:** [33:52.77 - 33:56.70] What the Dey child,D E C I C H I L D.

**spk_0:** [33:56.77 - 33:58.05] But what in the world is that?Well,

**spk_6:** [33:58.17 - 34:24.73] this is a concept whereby you're supposed to help your population by,by dividing licenses for having children into units of 1 10th,and you can sell these licenses to build up a full 10 or a full percentage point,or you can.A bargain with other people to come up with another percentage point and therefore gain your license to have a child.

**spk_0:** [34:25.84 - 34:32.92] Kay,do you really mean that in a public school textbook they're talking about controlling our right to have children,

**spk_6:** [34:33.28 - 34:44.17] right?As a matter of fact,it's,and I'm quoting from the book,in the United States,the allotment would be 2.1 licenses.The licenses would be divisible in units of 1/10,

**spk_0:** [34:44.25 - 34:53.97] and if I wanted to have more than 2.5 children,I would have to go buy or barter these coupons from somebody who didn't want any children.That's right.

**spk_6:** [34:54.29 - 35:03.55] Let me continue to quote.Thus,those who want more than 2 children can afford to buy the extra license or can acquire them by a gift are free to do so.

**spk_0:** [35:03.89 - 35:10.48] Well,how,how do they plan to keep the people who who can't afford it from having more children?

**spk_6:** [35:10.99 - 35:12.03] Well,that's a good question.

**spk_0:** [35:12.15 - 35:14.59] That's what China's doing right now,isn't it?

**spk_6:** [35:14.87 - 36:00.73] Well,I would imagine they would resort to some of the other theories that they've promoted.For for example,another thing,and let me tell you from the book so you'll know that I'm telling you the truth because it is sort of hard to believe,it is possible that some of the social forces that exist in the United States and to.And greed and many other developed nations may bring about a stabilization of population.These include the demand for new roles by women,the promotion of the benefits of smaller families,the choice to begin a family at a later age,the demand by many women for freedom over their reproductive functions.And of course the widespread availability of birth control devices and information,the removal of tax incentives for having large families.

**spk_0:** [36:01.36 - 36:06.40] Well,well,Kay,tell me,uh,did this book go into the Louisiana schools or did you keep it out?

**spk_6:** [36:06.52 - 36:26.04] As a matter of fact,we were successful in keeping this particular book out,uh,4 years ago.However,I did learn just this past month that these people were back again knocking at our door for,uh,uh,trying to get on the state adopted textbook list,and they were able to do so with a later edition.Well,

**spk_0:** [36:26.16 - 36:44.49] I wish you,I wish you luck.In keeping it out,and I think it's a total disgrace that that sort of brainwashing is called science.It isn't science at all.It's trying to inculcate some very socialist attitudes into the minds of schoolchildren.You're definitely correct.Thank you very much for calling,Kay.We'll go to the next caller.

**spk_1:** [36:44.65 - 36:48.63] Houston,Texas.It's KTEK,and here's Gaille Phyllis.Hello,

**spk_0:** [36:48.73 - 38:30.54] Gaille,what is your question or comment?My comment is I was just reading the newspaper,the suburb.Reporter West,and it's August 17,1989,and they're talking about the challenge program offered for,um,KISD gifted children.And it's,um,as far as I'm concerned,a lot of global,uh,leadership and thinking development and the curriculum includes mentor programs,Houston area model United Nations,mock trial,Odyssey of the Mind,future problem solving.Etc.etc.um,field trips and then they go on to tell how they take the gifted children and through teacher recommendation,etc.to be in the program in the following fall semester.Well,if I had a child in the public schools,I would not let that child go in any course for the so-called talented and gifted children because our experience is that the nuttiest programs come in those areas.And this is a course or a textbook that you're reading from a curriculum.This is from the newspaper article announcing what they're going to be doing.I wish you'd send our parents advisory Center a copy of that,Gaille.We'd like to know more about it and so that we're able to tell parents what to be on guard against.They're even doing it in the elementary school,and they're going to remove children one full day each week and send them to the satellite center.Now doesn't that require parental consent to?Well,I sure hope so.I don't have any small children,so I'm just watching what's going on.Well,please send us that information,Gail,and thank you very much for sharing it with us.Yes,and God bless you.Thank you.And our

**spk_1:** [38:30.54 - 38:51.94] information packet on global education is available to you.For $10 and also a cassette copy of this program will be available to you,so stay with us.Of course we'll be passing along our Eagle-Forum address and more of your telephone calls to come.Exciting conversation as every week,Phyllis,and on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_1:** [40:55.42 - 41:16.70] From the USA Radio Network across America,this is P Phyllis-Schlafly Live talking about global education this week.And a quick reminder that any gift from you is a yes vote to help us stay on the air via satellite,a program so informative on parents' rights and education.It's P Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Let's go back out to St.Louis and here's Susan for Phyllis.

**spk_0:** [41:16.80 - 41:22.00] Hello Susan,it's your turn.Phyllis.Hello Susan.What is your question or comment?

**spk_4:** [41:23.08 - 41:52.72] Ah,this program has been very interesting to me today.I just can't believe,uh,uh,all these things that they've been talking about the United Nations,even though I've known for a long time that it's the greatest fraud in all history.Its purpose is to destroy the United States,it seems to me.Ah,in doing some research study here a while back about the UN,I found out it had 32 specialized agencies.And I couldn't believe when you mentioned Alger Hiss as being the first Secretary General of the UN a while ago on your program.

**spk_0:** [41:52.83 - 41:53.54] Well,it's true.

**spk_4:** [41:53.96 - 42:05.76] Well,I know,I know.And being a nurse,uh,my,uh,what I will talk about probably you won't think,you know,starting out that it has anything to do with education.Well,

**spk_0:** [42:05.88 - 42:09.52] come to the point quickly because we only have a little time left and we have several calls waiting,

**spk_4:** [42:09.68 - 42:52.59] OK.Um,what I've noticed is that when Elger Hiss went to the UN along with Brock Chisholm,they redefined the definition of the World Health Organization.As a young nurse,uh,the very education that they came over from the foreign countries when Hitler took over.Uh,to teach the mentally ill people in the state hospitals,they are now using that psychology,calling it education to value clarify all of our society from before we're even born,and they want the soul of all human life.And then on they have a program for every age and stage,and if you don't,uh,you have to,uh,abide by the way they teach or you're A defect and we're just getting more and more like the communists.

**spk_0:** [42:52.60 - 43:02.72] Well,I notice you're using the word clarify.Anybody who's been studying education and knows about values clarification knows that clarification is a word that really means changing your values,

**spk_4:** [43:02.76 - 43:47.11] and that's exactly what they do from the before that baby's even born,beginning in family planning.They want to tell you how many children and if you should have that child or not have that child.And as soon as that child is born,that child is given a test.It's called a Denver Developmental Screening around here,but it's got,it has many names,and what they do,they test that child and that family for the role they will play,for the job they'll have,and what for the rest of their life there's going to be,you know,there's going to be planning,they're going to be numbered,and right in the Steve,we have got a perinatal management tracking system that has a number for these children and that family,and they know all about them then from then on until they die.

**spk_0:** [43:47.61 - 43:54.57] Well,thank you very much,Susan,for calling in.We appreciate your insight into this.Let's go to the next call.I'm sorry we have to rush along.

**spk_1:** [43:54.69 - 43:58.61] Let's check in with Denver,Colorado,and for Phyllis-Schlafly,Jamie.

**spk_0:** [43:59.07 - 44:02.19] Hello hello Jane.What is your question or comment?

**spk_4:** [44:02.37 - 44:15.65] Um,Phyllis,I apologize.I hadn't got to hear the first part of your program.Uh,had you mentioned the fact that,um,President Bush has set up a comment line and wanting the people's opinion on the ABC bill?

**spk_0:** [44:16.12 - 44:18.93] Uh,no,no.Do you have that number of the comment line?

**spk_4:** [44:19.05 - 44:32.42] I sure do.I called that number earlier this week and they said that President Bush was sort of taking the pulse of the nation to find out whether people were for or against the ABC bill,and they were simply taking a challenge.

**spk_0:** [44:33.91 - 44:45.59] Well,that's what they do on the opinion line.They send a message up to the president of so many called in in favor of the ABC federal babysitting bill,and so many called in against it.Well,

**spk_4:** [44:45.79 - 45:07.10] right now they're asking how many want him to veto it.So I thought that was interesting,but the number is 202.456763 9 Again,it was 202.456-7639.

**spk_0:** [45:07.68 - 45:29.42] Well,thank you very much for telling that.I do believe in calling in and giving your opinion.It looks like this liberal Congress may very well pass a,a very expensive federal regulation of babysitting,and we do urge President Bush to veto it.So call in on the opinion line.And give your opinion and thank you very much for calling,Jane.We will have to go to the next caller now.

**spk_1:** [45:29.57 - 45:32.02] Phyllis,let's see what Dot has from Jackson,Mississippi.

**spk_0:** [45:32.14 - 46:51.47] Hello,Dot,what is your question or comment?Yes,Phyllis,I'm concerned that public schools are failing to teach patriotic values.Do you think that because there is no emphasis placed on the teaching of American history,that many students aren't learning what makes our country unique and what has precipitated this trend and what can be done to correct it?It isn't any accident,as you know,several years ago,history and geography were phased out as particular subjects,and they were replaced with social studies.So then it's all a mishmash,and they don't really teach the American Constitution or the Declaration of Independence or our American institutions or our heritage or our traditions or our,our heroes.Many Americans really don't know about our heroes and they don't teach why the United States is so great that everybody else in the whole world wants to come here.You're not born knowing these things.You have to be taught them,and we used to be taught them.I remember when I was in the 3rd grade we had a wonderful book called Great Americans for Little Americans,and there was one chapter after another about the great American heroes,but I find that the schools today,uh,don't teach about American heroes.Are you still there,Dot?

**spk_4:** [46:52.82 - 46:55.73] I'm just wondering what can we do to reverse this trend.

**spk_0:** [46:55.99 - 47:19.98] I,uh,strongly urge parents to read the textbooks in the schools to find out what is being taught,and as one of the callers said earlier on this program,look for the things that are not there.That is where the patriotism,the,uh,the respect for the American way of life,for our institutions,for our freedom.Uh,has just been deep sexed.It isn't there.

**spk_1:** [47:20.29 - 47:26.42] Quickly,let's move on to Trenton,New Jersey over at WCHR.Here's Cheryl.We've got about 30 seconds.Cheryl,

**spk_0:** [47:26.62 - 47:30.10] Cheryl,quickly,what is your question?I was wondering what their slant is

**spk_6:** [47:30.10 - 47:43.33] on Israel.I have a feeling they're as down on Israel as they are on us because that's what an example of patriotism and feeding their people.I think they have 10 harvests over there.I mean,a country that was only started in 1948,and I believe it's probably safer to walk the streets

**spk_4:** [47:43.33 - 47:44.82] of Jerusalem than it is in New York City.

**spk_0:** [47:45.09 - 48:08.53] Ah,well,I'll,I'll bet that,I'll bet that's true,and it,uh,Israel certainly is an example of people working very hard to get,uh,their livelihood out of a,a place with very few natural resources which is fundamentally a desert.So,um,I think Global Ed doesn't teach that.Global Ed teaches we should have an international authority that should allocate the resources.So thank you for calling,Cheryl.

**spk_1:** [48:08.62 - 48:14.19] Phyllis,I'll be interested to get your closing comments on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_5:** [48:14.41 - 49:11.85] You've heard it said,the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world.Who's rocking the cradle today,the government or the family?Get answers to these questions and find out what you can do.Read Who Will Rock the Cradle,a new book on child care from Eagle-Forum.Who Will Rock the Cradle is an excellent resource.You'll get valuable information to discuss intelligently and debate effectively.Use it to persuade your elected officials that mother care is important.And that government day care is no substitute.Who will rock the cradle challenges young parents to understand that the most precious gift they can give their children is mother care.Who will rock the cradle?Get your copy today.Send 1495 to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Who will rock the cradle?Make your check for $1495 payable to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002

**spk_7:** [49:12.14 - 50:08.47] informing the public about real issues in education today.That's the job of Radio Live with Phyllis Schlaffly,but we need your help.Encourage your friends to listen to the program and thank this station for carrying it.Get your friends a cassette copy of this program.Give a subscription of the education reporter to your church or child's teacher.And don't forget about our packets that accompany information discussed on the program each week.Packets are available for $10 each on topics such as AIDS education,sex education,new age education,drug education,Quest,the NEA,and more.Send $5 for cassettes and $10 for packets to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Remember to specify the date of the program and topic when you order.That's $5 for cassettes and $10 for packets to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.

**spk_0:** [50:11.78 - 50:50.49] As we've seen on this program,global education is not teaching about history and geography.Global education is indoctrinating students with very specific attitudes.The notion that we have scarce natural resources and an international authority should parcel them out.The notion that we should control population.In order to enjoy these resources,the notion that disarmament is the road to peace instead of military strength,the notion that interdependence somehow would be better than independence of the United States,please join us again next week when we will be talking about illiteracy,a big problem today.
