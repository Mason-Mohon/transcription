**spk_0:** [00:02.20 - 00:11.69] It's a whole new vocabulary,guided imagery,human potential,channeling,meditation,out of body experiences.That's new age in the public schools.

**spk_1:** [00:12.97 - 01:00.74] Welcome to what I'm certain will be an informative hour of conversation.This is Bruce Hayes inviting you to join us.Jot down our toll-free number early and get in while you can at 1-800-736-3202.Certain this new age conversation is certain to attract a lot of calls,Phyllis,you know,new age is a very trendy subject that we hear more and more about.I mean,when I go to the bookstore,I see whole racks of books labeled New Age.Bookstores usually have 4 or 5 books by the actress Shirley MacLaine.We've heard so much about her and of course on Point of View we've heard about Shirley.Look at all the publicity about Nancy Reagan's new book My Turn,in which she admitted that she became dependent on an astrologer,Joan Quigley.Phyllis,what's going on here?

**spk_0:** [01:01.01 - 01:44.11] Well,a lot of kooky things are going on,Bruce,but we're concerned on this program only with how new age plays in the public school classroom.The first time I heard about This was several years ago when a parent called in our parents' advisory center and said her little child had come home and told her mother that the teacher had told her she had a wise man living inside of her.I had never heard of that before,but since then we've found that more and more schools are teaching children how to contact their spirit guides,their higher self,or their inner wisdom.Sometimes this spirit is a wise man living inside them.Sometimes it's a rabbit on a green pasture.In any event,these teachings have no place in the public schools.

**spk_1:** [01:44.55 - 01:49.34] Do the schools give assignments based on these new age concepts?

**spk_0:** [01:49.43 - 02:16.41] Well,most of the time they're exercises in class.Sometimes they're told they're to reduce stress,but we find that some students have been told to research their astrological sign or how to build a Ouija board or how to read poems.They are sometimes taught yoga and meditation.And they're put through techniques of guided imagery and visualization.So I hope we have some callers who tell what's actually going on so the listeners will believe that this is really happening.

**spk_1:** [02:16.56 - 02:26.46] Come on in from anywhere in America.1-800-736-3202.1st.From Almogordo,New Mexico,and here's Maude.

**spk_0:** [02:26.62 - 14:43.89] Hello,Maude.Hello there.Have you had any experience with these new age techniques in the public school classroom?Oh yes,I'm listening to what you're saying,Phyllis,and down here in New Mexico we're just a sanctuary for that type of program.Well,tell us an example.All right,for instance,let me tell you about what a parent found in the Albuquerque public schools.2 or 3 years ago,and this has been prevalent in a number of schools.This was in a little program that they call doo.Oh,do so.We've had a lot of calls from parents in the last 3 or 4 weeks inquiring about doo.Doo is D U S O.What does that stand for?Pardon?Do you know what that stands for?Yes,Developing understanding of self and others.But,and it's usually in about a 2nd or 3rd grade given by the school counselor as it was in the Albuquerque public schools.Now a kiddo can come home and tell the parent that they're having a little do so exercise,but how does a 2nd grader come home and explain developing understanding of self and others,you know.So,uh,what the parents found in Albuquerque,one mother had her child becoming very disturbed and not being able to sleep at night,a 2nd grader,and when she inquired about what the problem was with the child,she found out that through the year the child had been taken out of the classroom with the other children.Taken to a counselor's office and listen to tapes or talked about some of these little matters they talk about in these little humanistic programs,do so.In this case,the children were asked to lie down on the floor.That seems to be a very favorite technique.I've heard from a lot of parents about children being told to lie down on the floor,lie down on the floor,and then the tape would be played with music and with a little bit of a dialogue by a person who would say,now we're going to start relaxing from our toes and our knees and on up the body,and then now your body is rising up and you're floating away.I have all of these tapes because a parent sent them to me and wanted me to analyze them.Well,do you think it's a kind of self hypnosis?It is.It's this out of body experience being done with little children,and in all the music and the tapes,Phyllis,what is interesting,the child is told,taken on this little out of body experience adventure to a very favorite.Private place and it's they're told by this narrator on the tape,now this is your special little place and you don't tell anybody about it.Translated,that means your parents can't go there,right,right.In a sense that's in the dialogue.So this mother in Albuquerque went to the school after her child told her,2nd grader,about what was happening.She found that her her girl in the 3rd or 4th grade was having the same thing.Now these were being done by a school counselor,and I would caution people listening,find out what your school counselors are doing.Ask for the material that your school counselors are using because we find that you can go to the school and you find what your child might be taught in social studies because there's a textbook.You can find out what your child is being taught in math because there's some material there,a book,but find out what your counselors are doing because you'll find no curriculum material.So how does the parent really,really understand or find out what's going on?We have to go and ask now.The parent in Albuquerque who ran into this and opened the door to this issue for us in New Mexico could not get any satisfaction from the teacher.Would they give her the cassettes?No,she had to finally demand the cassettes,and she got a hold of the cassettes and took them away from the school and made copies of them.Um,she found out.Well,I,I must say I find it outrageous when the school will,will not let the parent,uh,see or look or listen to the material that's being given to their own children.Right?Well,in this case,this mother found also being used by the counselor through the school there other books such as Meditating with Children,which is a new age booklet.She found the teacher had or the counselor had Flights of Fantasy,which is another new age handbook,and she found the booklet Wizards.Now one of these books she could not get from the school.So where did she find it,Phyllis?She went looking in a,uh,a new age occultic bookstore in Albuquerque and found the book there.And so she put all of this material together.The principal of the school would not listen to her.She finally eventually took this to the school board meeting and the school superintendent.And then eventually after her,um,about a year's work,she got one of our senators to introduce this in the state legislature that this type of material,out of body experiences,visualization,all of these psychological techniques could not be used in the classrooms in New Mexico.The the senator got a resolution passed through the legislature.It was a Senate resolution which does not bear the weight of a law,but it did make the state school board sit up and take notice and have to deal with this issue.It was also a consciousness raising process for the public who had no idea that this sort of thing was going on in the New Mexico public schools.And uh what I want to point out is that uh this type of material,the do so program is being used in many,many schools.It is to me a forerunner of what we're fighting right now in New Mexico,and that is the QuestT program,Q U E S T.Yes,we've had a program on that and we've had very many calls from parents who object to the quest program.Well,this is a forerunner.It's preparing the children for this self-esteem,for finding their inner self,for,as you mentioned,the spirit,the spirit guide in yourself or your higher self.And it is where the children are allowed to talk about problems at home or their feelings about other people.It's another one of these packaged humanistic programs that are being sold to the schools.Well,do you think all this is an attempt to teach the child that there's some kind of a God subs.or a pseudo god or a force that they can consult with and to set up a consulting procedure that deals out the parents.Truly,I think so,Phyllis,and it's another one of these humanistic techniques to divorce the child from those values that have been taught at home.From those moral values and take away the moral values and as a moral clarification and instead substitute the values clarification.Well,did I hear you say that the parent,uh,it took her a year to get this out of the school a year for the process to get the material to get an admission from the school.The parent was absolutely ostracized by the school because she went to the school and began to question this and object.So she went up the chain of command to the school board and the superintendent,then finally to the legislature.She took these tapes that were played in the classroom and the books.She played the tapes for a Senate committee hearing so the senators could hear actually what was going on in the classroom.Well,when these new age psychologists talk among themselves,they really openly admit to the religious underpinnings of this.Type of psychological approach,but when it comes into the classroom,it's usually disguised or glossed over,uh,in order to get it accepted.They'll talk about stress,uh,and they need to do,uh,to save the little children from stress.These,these anti-stress classes usually come in kindergarten,1st,and 2nd grades,and,uh,they will say to parents,Well,don't you want your children to learn how to cope with stress?Well,they're talking about stress,Phyllis,and self-esteem at the 2nd grade level.How many little 2nd graders do you know that need to talk about self-esteem?And um it seems to me they ought to be taught how to read.I'm not sure they can read the word self-esteem anyway,um,Maude,uh,after the,after your New Mexico Senate passed this,uh,resolution,uh,what was the result on the education establishment?Uh,not.Much the resolution does not bear the weight of the law,of course,but the state school board had had to recognize that this had been passed and the state school board in a sense fumbled around with this resolution for a while.The parents who had brought the resolution into being did contact the board and said,let's do something with it,and they just made such an issue of it that the board says,well,we'll appoint a task force to study this and to define what is meant by this resolution.Fortunately,I knew the senator who had passed the resolution,and he asked me to serve on the task force.So we had 3 all day meetings on this to discuss this.You couldn't believe the opposition who came and sat in those meetings to oppose even what we were doing.Were they from the teaching establishment,establishment.There were some church people there,of course there were,there were some people from the occultic bookstores who were there.Uh,counselors from the schools,it was just that array of people who get up in arms when you find out this type of thing is going on.Eventually we drew up the guidelines to the,um,to the resolution.We defined the meaning of the resolution,and that was sent out to all the schools in New Mexico.Later on this had to come back to the state school board and their um their committee that set standards did not endorse it.However,this resolution is still in effect in New Mexico.Would you say this type of material is not to be used in the public schools?No,of course it's not.Maude,would you say that stress and self-esteem would be two of the key.Words that parents should look for in identifying any of these new age techniques in the classroom.I would say yes.Do you have any other words that are that parents should look for?I think those are pretty good key words.I think also if I were a parent and I preach this to my children now who have little children in school,watch out for what your child is being exposed to if there's a counselor in your school,and I'm saying all the way through the school years.But I had a call from a mother and I mean a teacher in Nebraska after this issue emerged in New Mexico.I wrote an article that was published in several publications.I believe it was in your Education Reporter.It was also published in Doctor Dobson's,uh,Focus on the Family,and I had a number of calls from across the nation from parents who saw my name and wanted to know more about this.Last year I had a call from a teacher,2nd grade teacher in Nebraska,and she said,we've had to do so program in our school one year,and she said,I'm on a committee now that is to evaluate the program to decide whether or not we keep it.And she said,uh,I talked to her a bit about the program,and she says,well,it's done by a young man who is our guidance counselor.He comes in the 2nd grade classroom.I nearly dropped the phone.I said,What are you doing with a guidance counselor in the 2nd grade?And she paused a minute and I questioned her again.I said,Can you answer that?And she said,I really don't know what we're doing with a guidance counselor in the 2nd grade.Well,we're,we're out of time,Maude,and we thank you for telling our listeners how to be a.Alert to what happens when the counselors come into the room.I'll also tell our listeners that a copy of that New Mexico Senate resolution will be in our packet on on new age,and we thank you for calling.Thank you.Appreciate your work.And how

**spk_1:** [17:15.62 - 17:32.71] On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly,and we're talking about new age.If you want to get in on the conversation,we invite your telephone call at 1-800-736-3202.Let's go out to Nora in Mount Laurel,New Jersey over WCHR from Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [17:32.87 - 20:54.92] Hello,Nora.What is your question or comment?Well,I have both,um,um,and to share with you a quick experience too,um,my question is,um,I'm a Christian.And I live in an area where there's lots of preschool children,and I've been telling my friends about your program and about everything that I've learned,and I was wondering if there's any information that I can give a non-Christian to,you know,make them aware of everything that's going on because it's a little overwhelming for them.I would say the best way for anybody to start,whether you're a.Christian or a non-Christian or a believer or unbeliever would be the book Child Abuse in the Classroom.It came out in 1984.I edited it.Uh,what I did was to get a hold of the transcripts of the hearings conducted by the US Department of Education across the country.There were 7 of these hearings.And hundreds of parents came in and gave their own firsthand testimony about what had happened to their children as a result of what they were taught in the classroom.It's authentic.It's real.It's a Department of Education document,and I think anybody would be shocked.You don't have to be a Christian to understand that what is going on in the public schools is offensive.to people and it is treading in areas that the schools have no business.uh,what,uh,what it really is is was best identified by Senator Sam Hayakawa who said that it's a heresy in education.Instead of teaching children knowledge and basic skills,the schools have turned into group therapy by unlicensed psychologists.So it's still a $5 book and it's still available.It's had a big sale,but it's the best introduction to what's wrong with the public schools today.Yes,well,I have to tell you my new age experience happened um through a prenatal course that I had and it was so subtle,but um I did notice it and a lot of the material that was in there and I did mention it to the teacher and she did take it out with a lot of affirmations and we were instructed to.Um,repeat these things daily and um one of the papers had something about a one world government and you know it's,it's was this,was this in the public school,Nora?No,this wasn't,but I'm just,the point I want to make is it's not just in the public school,but it's in everything.I mean,how would you expect to have a new age thing in your prenatal course?Is that supposed to enable you to survive labor a little easier or what?No,the Lord did that.It didn't help one bit,but it is very subtle,and people need to be aware,and it's so much in the school,even in Mount Laurel,you know,I,I got a flyer about the stress management class for kindergartens and what a kindergartner needs with stress.I don't know.Well,I think sometimes the stress is created by what they get in the schools.I've seen some of the books where they will,will tell them that monsters are coming to get them or they will have pictures of monsters or they will tell them that all tests are monsters and,and create an an.Anxiety that they didn't have in the first place.Well,we really appreciate your calling,Nora.Thank you so much.Your,your program is doing a lot of good,and I'm telling everybody about it.Well,you tell all your friends to listen.Thanks a lot.

**spk_1:** [20:55.16 - 20:59.20] Let's travel out to Houston,Texas over KETK.Here's Jim.

**spk_0:** [20:59.40 - 23:19.54] Hello,Jim.Yeah,yes ma'am.What is your question or comment?Well,it's mostly a comment,but a question too.Uh,does your new age packet cover humanism?Well,we have material on humanism.Uh,the,the new age packet would be particularly on some of these techniques such as meditation and centering and the,the misuse of self-esteem in order to give,give students some of the practices of the Eastern mystical religions,but we have a lot of material on humanism too.Yeah,because I noticed almost all the new age groups and stuff I check,almost every one of these people has humanists in it,which is basically atheism.And some of the things I've been finding out about this,because I've read two of their books.I found out that the person who wrote Humanist Manifesto,the first one,John Dewey,they just finished banning 15 of his books out in Arkansas because it turns out he also wrote her school books.Well,he had a powerful influence on American education.Uh,but I think what what is important for parents today to recognize is that new age is a pseudo religion or an anti-religion or an attempt to tell children that there is a force in the world who will direct their lives or with whom they should consult instead of God or their pastor or their parents.And uh we find this very offensive to people's First Amendment rights.I remember earlier they were talking about guidance counselors in the school there.One thing I think a lot of parents ought to check out and demand in writing is the humanists have also got what's known as Project 10,which takes children behind closed doors without the parents' permission or knowledge,ask them certain questions they can't help but answer yes to,and then try to tell the children without the parents' knowledge or permission.That they're homosexuals.Well,Project 10 originated in the Los Angeles school district,and we do have a copy of the best article on that,uh,subject,uh,which appeared in a magazine called Valley,uh,in,uh,Southern California,and we'd be happy to send that to any of our listeners who write in.So thank you very much for calling.We appreciate your comments.

**spk_1:** [23:19.82 - 23:33.59] Another telephone call from 1-800-736-3202.Incidentally,best time to get in is when we hear somebody hang up.Let's go out to Ray in Scottsbluff,Nebraska over at KCMI for Phyllis Schlaffly.

**spk_0:** [23:33.70 - 27:29.51] Hello,Ray.What is your question or comment?Well,I wanted to just share a couple of things in regard to the situations with doo.And the peer dynamic situation.The community that we're in is very small.Uh,the city where we are is about 18,000 people.So when.National talk shows such as your visits with people in Philadelphia,Los Angeles,Denver,places like that,well,you almost expect,you know,weird and unusual things to be taking place.That's right.Usually we find people from small towns say,oh,the spooky things like that may happen in New York or San Francisco,but not in our fine little town.It used to be in small communities you would be anywhere from 5 to 8 years behind in whatever the East or the West Coast was working on.And with technology and other things that have taken place over the past 10 or 12 years and federal funding,that too,yes,it takes about,about a half a day.All right,tell us,tell us about do so in your town.OK,it's uh several of the schools use it.The schools have complaints about it and the way it's used through the work that I have done with some of the people around here.The success or the failure of the program depends completely on trusting the teacher,the,the person who is actually implementing the program.Uh,we've had some people go through the entire curriculum in a way that the Gablers do out of Texas and,um,uh,point out some things that are,are very,uh,against,uh,the grain of things with,uh,uh,morals,uh,let alone religious values.And some of the things that come up,even though there are different labels on it around the country,is,uh,relaxation,uh,techniques,meditation.We recently had some things where some students were in a different type of class,not so much in the developing understanding.Studying religions of the world and invited to go outside and practice yoga.Some things like that.Well,now,of course,yoga is a definite practice of some eastern mystical religion,but when you use the word relaxation,most of us think it's pretty good to be relaxed.So how do you tie that into something that is objectionable in the classroom?Well,what the,what the particular school that had a problem with that right off of the bat.Uh,was,uh,the relaxation to remain quiet and then it would play some tapes,uh,some music of ocean waves with some nice music with it,and,uh,some subliminal messages,although the teacher was not aware of what the messages were,but it was to help you with your self-esteem and that type of a thing.That relaxation technique was objectionable.They didn't have so much a problem with the kids coming in from recess and,and having,you know,a minute and a half or so to catch their breath.Two different applications.Did you get it removed from the schools?Uh,no,uh,they're having,uh,the one particular school is having some problems with that.Uh,they approached,uh,the school board and said,what we see going on in the school,uh,we do not agree with,and we would like to have our children removed from that class.And,uh,the school board had,uh,had the,had the parents really jump through some hoops and fill out a lot of paperwork and,uh,and now the kids,you know,instead of going to a study hall or a library situation,they sit them in the hallway.So they really retaliate against the children.They,they make them feel peculiar or ostracized for not being in the class.Are you having some telephone trouble or am I?Well,you're,you are because we're still hearing you,I believe.

**spk_1:** [27:29.61 - 27:33.51] We pay a lot of money for these lines,Ray,and you're calling from a pay phone.

**spk_0:** [27:34.45 - 28:40.84] Well,we do appreciate your calling in on the matter of meditation.Meditation is clearly a religious practice,and what did the schools say when you try to get the meditation out?Well,we're The,the,the school board proper,not all of them 100%,but of the majority of the parents who have come forward,uh.Medical,you know,you know,I mean that's what they call you.Oh yeah,and,uh,11 school board member called me a month and a half ago saying,what is secular humanism.Well,believe it or not,Ray,I've had a reporter asked me that question.Well,we're about out of time.We,we do appreciate your calling and,and sharing this with us,and,and,uh,you've given parents some,some good tips on how to look for this and be prepared to be called some kind of a,of a nut for objecting to it,but we do find that these courses very obnoxious to our religion,and we're gonna have to take a break,but I hope our callers will hang.On till after it's over.

**spk_1:** [28:41.01 - 30:48.60] Interesting caller indeed and lots more callers waiting to talk to you,Phyllis,about this whole topic of new age.It always sparks quite an interest throughout America when we do talk about it.Let me give you the toll-free number we'd like to hear from you.1-800-736-3202.Stay with us,more calls on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.For 22 years,the Phyllis-Schlafly Report has been giving readers more facts in fewer words than any publication in print.The P Phyllis-Schlafly report covers a broad spectrum of topics such as education,child care,national defense,economics,feminism,politics,and the US Constitution.This monthly publication is available to you for $15 per year.A price list of available back issues is yours for the asking with titles like Whose Values Do Public Schools Teach,Big Brother Wants to Be Big Mamma,The NEA's Ultra Left Agenda,and Battle Against Pornography.You will want to write soon and build your library with valuable back issues that are still timely.Write Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Ask for the price list and subscribe to the Phyllis Schlaffly report for $15.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.From the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we're taking your telephone calls talking about new age,the whole movement,out of body experiences,guided imagery,and channeling a lot of different aspects of this,and we're at 1-800-736-3202 if you'd like to join us.Phyllis,do you think most teachers in the public schools are Aware of the religious aspects of these materials?

**spk_0:** [30:48.71 - 31:12.93] No,I don't.I think most teachers have been to workshops where they've been taught that they need to do their part to eliminate stress among the children and to build their self-esteem,and they are told that the experts gave them these wonderful programs that are going to help their children in their classroom,and they simply don't realize how offensive they.to the First Amendment rights of those of us who believe in God.

**spk_1:** [31:13.05 - 31:24.24] A lot of people waiting to sound off on this topic agree or disagree.We'd like to hear from you.1-800-736-3202 out to Houston,Texas.And here's Betty.

**spk_0:** [31:24.41 - 33:26.59] Hello Betty.Oh,I was,oh,I tell you,I just tuned into your program earlier.I had,I,I listened to KETK all the time,and this is great.Well,good.Do you have a question or comment about new age in the public schools?Let me tell you what,uh,I have,um,uh,a grandchild that's going to kindergarten to a private school,and it is my son's child and he is divorced from the mother and the first thing that this,uh,2 weeks they were 2 weeks into the school year when.Uh,the mother was called to the school and said this child has attention deficit problems and he's,it's the problem is self-esteem.Well,sometimes when the school says that they immediately prescribe the drug Ritalin.Oh yeah,they,they've already done that and they've,uh,well,you know,we're against it.We're just absolutely against it,but being a grandmother,you know,you can't,I,I just must find out more.I,I've heard.That's right.I'm,I'm a grandmother.You can't exactly tell them what to do,but,uh,you do need to point out the dangers of some of these things.Uh,we do have a splendid article on Ritalin that is available to our listeners,and uh I think that there are millions more children who are put on that drug than should be.Well,uh,we're against it.I mean,you know,all told,because we don't believe this is the problem,we believe it's,it's the school itself,but would this be part of beings they have mentioned this,uh,uh,they're talking about just what you're talking about self-esteem and stress.Well,it all depends.Well,we're all against stress and we're in favor of self-esteem,but it's a matter of what practices they're using,whether they're using,uh,new age techniques such as centering or hypnosis or yoga,and so I suggest that you find out exactly what is being used in the classroom.Maybe your grandchild's too young to be in school altogether.You might consider that.Appreciate your call.Let's go to the next caller.New London,

**spk_1:** [33:26.63 - 33:28.96] Iowa,and Mike for Philly Schlaffly.

**spk_0:** [33:29.07 - 36:24.38] Hello,Mike.What is your question or comment?Yeah,I have a couple of things there.I enjoy your program,and we have a school here,and it's a small town,rural town in Iowa.And we have a thing called Transcendental Meditation.Tell us about it.It's about 25 miles from my house,and they moved in a number of years ago,and everybody got pretty worked up,and then they've kind of settled in,and I was up by there here a while back and they're,they're building buildings and Just growing like crazy up there now.Are you're talking about a group of people?Well,this is a university,the Maharishi University is what it's called,and I think one of the things that happened that we've seen around here that has happened is people were pretty worked up sometimes when these things first came in,and now we've kind of been lulled into a A sense of,well,they're just part of the community type deal and it's probably good for our,excuse me,good for our community.And I just wonder how much with the new age movement they work with it and then how much that happens to us as Christians and especially in our public schools that we just take some of these things and take them in stride and we don't realize where they're coming from and what they're doing.Well,we do have freedom of religion in this country and if these people want to believe in the Maharishi,that's their right to do that.The problem is when it comes into the public schools,and I think if they are,if these People are very prominent in your community,you better find out what's going on in the public schools.I,I've called your attention that in New Jersey several years ago,the parents found these techniques in the schools and they went to court and they got a court opinion,a court ruling and decision that the use of transcendental meditation techniques in school classrooms is a religious practice that violates the First Amendment.Supreme Court decisions.The case is Malno versus Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.I don't know if I pronounced that right,but in any event,it was the judgment that TM,that's Transcendental Meditation,is religious in nature and therefore the teaching of those techniques violates the First Amendment and has to be removed from the schools.So I urge you to check into that if that is big in your community.Well,you know that we've done what we can do in that,but how much of that.Disguised as something else,do you really think that's going on?I just wonder.That's right.I think a lot of it is disguised,as we said earlier on this program,as anti-stress practices or self-esteem,but you need to find out and examine it.And if you want to send any curricula into our parents advisory.Center,we'd be happy to hear from you.OK,that'd be great.Thanks.Thanks a million for calling.I think we'll move,we'll have to move along to our next caller.

**spk_1:** [36:24.49 - 36:27.78] Trenton,New Jersey,WCHR.And here's Maureen.

**spk_0:** [36:28.01 - 40:10.65] Maureen in New Jersey.What's your question or comment?Hi.Well,I was very interested to hear what you just had to say about in New Jersey about the court ruling,because I live in New Jersey and I've just come up against a problem.My son is in public school.And we've come up against a foreign language teacher who is teaching meditation,um.He came home from school a few weeks ago and said,I think my teacher is new age,and this also shows how important it is to let our sounds like you have a very smart son.Pardon me.It sounds like you have a very smart son.Yeah,um,he said,she says that she was a,um,previously a French princess in one of her past lives,and he said,What are you,new age?And she said,yes.What grade was this?9th grade.Um,and he went back and forth with her,and she,they both,I think,enjoyed the discussion about it,um.The other kids thought she was,you know,she's a very popular teacher and they think she's pretty cool,um,so I said,Well,we'd better keep an eye on this teacher and let me know if she does anything else,and he came home just a week ago and said,um,She said today,would we like to learn how to meditate and put on some kind of Indian type music with someone saying something and something he couldn't understand.And I was.Well,now just ask yourselves,suppose she had said,uh,uh,would you like to join me in saying a prayer?What do you think would happen?Well,I think that some child would go home and tell his parent,and the next day the school would get a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union threatening to sue them unless they reprimanded that teacher and admonished her never to do it again.Well,I told my son if she ever does that again,you get up and walk out of the class.Um,he said,Well,I'll get in trouble.I said,You just get up and you walk right out and tell them to call me because this is religion and it's not to happen in a public school.Well,I think it would be very useful for you to have a copy of this court decision which did take place in New Jersey,and armed with that you can have a very calm conversation with the teacher,with the principal,and I called the principal and I said,What is she doing?This is religion and It has no place in the public schools,and he said,no,this is just her um technique of helping the kids to relax and help them focus on the,the French,and,and I said no it isn't,it's religion.I said,are you aware of what the new age movement is?And he said no,and I proceeded to tell him,and he said,oh well,I'll have her call you.So she called me and she told me the same thing,you know,very nice lady,and um said.And I just teach the kids to relax and I'm not teaching them any religion.I said,well,maybe unwittingly you are,you know,Well,nevertheless,I think it would be very useful for you to have a copy of this court decision.And show them that meditation is to one of this type of new age religion as prayer is to the Christian religion and as long as we prohibit the one,we should prohibit the other.That's what I said.And I also called the school superintendent and I said to him,Do you know what the new age movement is?And he said,No.And I started to tell him and he said,Oh,you mean this whole showy McLean thing?I said,yes,and he understood and I said,the teacher's doing this,this.And he said to me,Well,I'll tell you what this isn't,and I thought he was going to make some excuses for it,you know,say it's not religion,but he said,this is not French,what she's there to teach.Well,that's right.Well,I thank you.We're out of time,Maureen.We appreciate your call.

**spk_1:** [42:30.72 - 42:42.73] On the USA Radio Network,we're talking about the whole new age movement in the public schools on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.It's Back out to the telephone calls in Fresno,California,KCI.Here's Gene.

**spk_0:** [42:43.09 - 46:29.12] Hello,Gene,what is your question or comment?Hi,uh,I am,uh,I just got a hold of Teacher Manuel.For the new Houghton Mifflin Language arts program in Jean,talk into the telephone a little louder so I can hear you better.Oh,OK.Uh,the language arts program,uh,which is a literature-based,a holistic approach,what I seem to see in it is that it's an indoctrination.Of,uh,they have guided reading by the teacher.Uh,they sit in groups and they share their feelings.They do a lot of journal writing.There is visualization,uh,in the oral language section,they do chanting.Now,when I checked into that,I,uh,what I found was there was no instructional program.What it was explained to me is that it's repeating of poems with rhythm to it.It's like choral reading,they said.Well,cha chanting is clearly one of the new age techniques.Uh,what grade is this being used in?Uh,well,it's all throughout the elementary and.Middle schools,I believe,too.It goes up to the 8th grade.They just implemented it this year and I don't know how many parents in Fresno know about this because I found this out by accident.You're probably the only one.Pardon?You're probably the only one.Who knows about it.Yes,Basically what I see in,in what I'm reading here is that they are re-socializing these kids into activists.We have animal rights subjects in here,Planned Parenthood subjects,peace,new gers,and apartheid,uh,from what I've been reading so far.And what is the name of this series?It's the Houghton Mifflin Language Arts Program.Does it have a name?Is it the Impression series?That's it.That's the name of the series,the Houghton Mifflin.And it's a literature-based program.And a lot of the literature,uh,that,uh,in the core books deal with,uh,a lot of new age like A Wrinkle in Time.By Madeleine Le Ele.Uh,there is another one,Tuck Everlasting,which they deal with immortality.And it's just amazing,uh,well,with all the great literature there is to give children,uh,they,they pick these oddball kooky things in order to implant ideas in the children,uh,which are,uh,contribute to the new age ideas.Yes.What I think what disturbs me more than anything is the fact that there is not really a lot of skills being taught the mechanics of language and of reading.I see you're absolutely right.All,all of this other stuff has replaced the skills.Now,uh,we've heard that the La Puente Hacienda School District is considering pulling the Impression series out.And if you will contact our parents advisory Center,we'll try to give you some help on that.It would be helpful if you would get your copy of it and get a little group together of parents who share your values and your concern.OK,that sounds great.All right,well,you contact our office and,and we will try to give you some help with this and send us a copy of what you find objectionable.Thank you very much for calling.We need to go to another caller,

**spk_0:** [46:32.72 - 48:26.53] Hello,Shelly.Uh yes,hi.What is your question or comment?Oh,I have a lot of questions and comments.Good,but,but basically,um,I'm calling.I'm a born again Christian who has been.I'm blessed with the occasional ability to have an antibody experience,for lack of a better term,and I,I just don't understand why you find This objectionable and against God.I do understand.I do believe it's wrong to teach this sort of thing.Uh,first of all,I don't think it's something that can be taught.If it happens,it happens.But I don't understand why you feel it is against.Well,I think,I think you have the right to do whatever you want.I just don't think it has any place in the public school classroom.That's all we're discussing on this program.I understand that.People are often disturbed by something that they don't understand and that they don't have experience with,and I would feel that if a child had been taught earlier in life to be able to handle this sort of situation,if in the unlikely event that they did eventually have an out of body experience,they would be prepared.They,um,Well,well,let's put it,let's put it this way,they do separate it from God.I think it's terrible that they do not allow prayer in the school,and I think that separating.This from Well,let's put it this way,Shelly.We,we just don't think the school has any right to prepare the little 1st grader or 2nd grader for an out of body experience.That's not what the school is for.That's not why we send our children to school.So we,we appreciate your call and thank you for your insight.We're going to take one more call before this program runs out.Uh,Patricia in

**spk_0:** [48:28.97 - 49:46.72] Hello Patricia.What is your question or comment?Hi,I wanted to ask a question.I received this notice from my daughter's school.I'm not going to mention the school,and it's from the uh uh the the PTA board,and they have,uh,because we're supposed to like check different programs that we would like,um,to come into our school if we're interested in it,and it has programs like,um,They look like OK programs.One is uh building children's self-esteem,and the other is like safe at home alone program and fire safety program and the youth suicide program and parenting,the underdeveloped skills and National PTA AIDS Education Project,Drug and alcohol abuse prevention program,Math Matters,a kit for parents and Reflections,National PTA essay contest.All right,well,we're nearly out of time,but let me say,many of those.Subjects uh have a lot of areas of concern for parents.We certainly do not believe in their giving the children suicide education.There's no reason why elementary school children need to be taught how to be parents and,uh,when it gets into the drug courses,they have some very questionable material.So I'm glad you're concerned.Find out what's in the courses before you approve letting your child go into them.

**spk_0:** [52:10.68 - 52:50.87] We've been talking today about new age techniques used in the public school classroom.Parents should look into what's going on.Such words as stress courses,self-esteem courses are clue words that they might be teaching your child something that is antagonistic to your religion.A centering and relaxation are fundamental processes for the new age course because they teach the child that he has a space inside of himself for listening to a voice of that person who I can tell you is not God.So look into what your children are learning and tune in next week when we're going to talk about the subject of R-rated movies shown in the classroom.
