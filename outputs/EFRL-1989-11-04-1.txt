**spk_0:** [00:00.51 - 14:37.89] Did you know that some public school students are shown R-rated videos in the classroom and that these objectionable films are shown without parental knowledge or consent?Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.This is Bruce Hayes inviting you to stay with us for the next hour.I'm sure it'll be a lively conversation on this one,Phyllis,and of course interesting and informative conversation.Where are you?Come on in.1-800-736-3202.Phyllis,did I hear you say that some public school students are spending classroom time watching R-rated videos?I mean,that means movies that young teenagers are.Not even supposed to see in the theaters unless they're accompanied by a parent,but the schools show them in class without parental consent or knowledge.That's right,Bruce,and we covered one of these cases in the current issue of our monthly education reporter.We've got on the line with us today,the mother who discovered this situation in her son's school,and she did something to make sure that it will not happen again.Well,let's jump on that first call,but Before we do,let me remind our listeners that if they've had an experience with videos being shown in the classroom,and Phyllis,you've heard about lots of experiences and can provide some insight to this whole topic,if they have a question,please feel free to call us on our toll-free number 1-800-736-3202 and tell us your experience.Now,let's go to Yucca Valley,California.Talk to Cathy.Hello,Cathy.Tell us how you.First found out about classroom time being spent on videos instead of on academic lessons.Well,the way it began was,um,my son came home and,ah,he actually was kind of complaining about it because he was getting kind of bored.He had seen 3 movies in school.Well,tell us what grade level this was and what class it was.OK,he's 11th grade and,ah,it was an English class.And,ah,it began in May.Ah,it's the first video he saw was the 11th of May,and between the 11th of May and June 15th,he was shown,ah,seven videos,and one was PG,one was PG-13,and the other five were rated R.And,um,after he'd seen the third video,he came home and made a remark about,ah,that all they were doing was seeing movies.Well then,Well,well,let me ask you,Cathy,uh,the video takes longer than class time.Oh yes,oh yes,3 classes,3,in the quarter in the time that I,I gave you between February and June,there's 44 classroom days,and out of those 44 classroom days.21 of them were spent viewing videos.That's half the time.So what,so what did you do?Well,so what,what did I do?Well,the reason what I did was I allowed it to continue,and I've,I've gotten quite a bit of criticism for that.But the reason I did was because I had gone to the Board of Education two years previously.And expressed a concern that there was some abuses going on because um a math teacher had shown the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,the Texas Chainsaw Massacre,yes,and,uh,and so,uh,I was concerned about the abuse at that time.So the Board of Education.And did send out some directives.So,but they felt that it was an isolated incident.They didn't really feel it was a serious problem.So the reason I allowed it to continue was for that reason and also because of retaliation on my son because the teacher had made a remark,uh,telling the kids that if they went home and told their parents what they were seeing that she wouldn't be able to show the films anymore.And,uh,so naturally,you know,I,I felt that she was trying to get out of,of doing some work,but she was also,uh,showing some really questionable,extremely horrible stuff,and,uh,he came home one day and said,well,boy,now they're getting into nudity and This is,this is English class.This is English class.Well,didn't they have any lessons to do in English class?She was giving them a written assignment and,uh,for example,she showed,uh,the movie Good Morning,Vietnam.And that's R rated and,uh,she had them write an essay on Vietnam,but the actual story is,um,is about a radio broadcaster in,you know,supposedly it's Robin Williams,and there's quite a bit of strong language in the movie.Movie.It really has nothing to do historically.It's not authentic at all.Well,what were the names of the other R rated films that were shown in this English class?Oh,some real classics.We had,um,uh,a movie called Betrayed with a woman named Deborah Winger.There was nudity in that one,and,uh,there was,uh,The Fly,which was the 1986 version,and there was some really explicit sex scenes in that,and,uh,Aliens.Uh,and that was,uh,that,that had some strong language,some really,I mean,you know,bad stuff,um,and then a movie called Robocop which,um,Had some of the most graphic violence against police officers that I,I've never seen anything like that.I saw about a one minute clip of that particular one,and it was without a doubt the worst thing I've ever seen.Well,so what did you do?You,you let the,uh,whole term finish with the showing of these videos,and then what did you do?Well,uh,school got out the 15th of June,and all of this time I was,I was collecting data.I had dates,the exact dates that the movies were shown and the length of time and what the,the written assignment supposedly was,and,uh,so on.And then on the 20th of June I went to the Board of Education.Um,my husband and two other men took clips of films and put them together,pieced them together on a video tape.And we sat the Board of Education down in front of this,and there were,it was the 7 minutes,and it showed between 30 and 30 seconds and 1 minute of 5 different videos that were shown,and,uh,because my son's class was not the only one that saw our rated movies,there was a Spanish class that showed a movie Die Hard,and then there was uh another movie called Young Guns that was rated R that was shown in a,a driver's education class.And uh that's a western,so I don't know what that had to do with driver's ed,but uh so what was,what was the reaction from the school board?Well,they were horrified,just absolutely horrified,and,uh,I think like myself they didn't realize,you know,when you hear that a movie is rated R,I mean,you know that it's not supposed to be appropriate viewing,but this is,this is beyond what,what I think most of us realize.And,uh,it's,uh,the thing,I mean,I was embarrassed.I'm,I'm an adult and,uh,I was embarrassed to sit and watch some of the things that we showed.It was,it was horrible.I was,I told them I was glad the room was dark because I was so embarrassed.I had to look at the floor.And so what did the school board do?Well,uh,of course they immediately said that they would look into it.And in fact that evening the principal of the school was there and they called him into closed session right away.And I don't,of course I don't know what was discussed there.All I know is that they went into closed session at the end of the meeting to question him and,uh,and then.Since that time,now this was the 20th of June,on the 19th of September,so June July August September 3 months later,it took to actually get a policy.The Board of Education finally adopted a policy that restricts,um,how that they can use videos in the classroom,but I have to tell you it does not specifically restrict the use of R-rated movies.But it does require the students to get permission from the principal.Uh,it requires the teacher to explain,uh,why that they want to show a video and the purpose of the video.There is a committee that has to view the films.Uh,in order to,uh,in order for it to be approved,is that a committee,is that a committee of teachers,Cathy?I,I'm afraid it probably.What was the attitude of the teachers while you were going through this controversy?Well,since the,since the teacher who did this was not,her name is not allowed to be mentioned,uh,publicly,uh,because she's protected through her,her union,um.So the reaction of the teachers was that it was mine and my husband's fault.It was all our fault that,um,uh,all of this trouble was being caused and that their academic freedom was going to be,uh,taken away from them and that their First Amendment rights were being violated.Did they oppose the adoption of the policy?Not all of them,but,uh,there was a significant number that showed up at one board meeting.There was about 20.Uh,we have 400 teachers in our district and,uh,there were about 20 that showed up at a specific meeting.I know there were others,but at this one particular meeting there were about 20,so I mean it was a significant amount,but,uh.Um,and I mean those were just the ones that came to the board meeting to express that they said that their professionalism was being,um,assaulted or questioned,um,that,uh,well,as I said,their First Amendment rights,their academic freedom,their freedom of speech was being taken away from them.And,uh,oh,and they mentioned separation of church and state which just I,I didn't well,I,I guess parental rights don't figure on their scale of values at all.I guess parental rights don't figure unless you agree with them.We don't have First Amendment rights apparently unless we agree with,with what they,well,quite,quite apart from the showing of the R rated videos,uh,what are we paying the teachers for?Why did they go to college and get a degree in education if what they're going to do for.50% of the time in class is just uh punch up the VCR and show a video.Well,you know,you're right.And not just that,but you know,there's also not only are they,are they just punching up a video,but the things they're showing are absolutely directly.Attacking their parents' values,you know,well,we certainly do congratulate you,Kathy,for,uh,seeing this through and getting the school board to adopt a good policy that we hope will prohibit that in the,in the future.We congratulate you.We're going to go to another call and thank you very much for sharing your story with us.And what about your stories?We're at 1-800-73.3202 from anywhere in America.Let's go out to Brookfield,Wisconsin,and it's Mary calling over WKSH.Hello Mary.Uh,thank you.What is your question or comment?Uh,I have a comment.This is a more isolated incident than your last caller's story,but this is regarding the viewing in our public school classroom in the high school of the Faces of Death video.My husband and I learned that this was going on through a group of sophomores we teach in a,uh,church class,and,um,our daughter was not in the class as such,but we were very concerned that this type of video would be brought into the classroom.So I went to the assistant principal and I asked him about this and would he do some research and his research information basically brought,uh,back to us that the class was the principles of American democracy for a unit on capital punishment.That the teacher had no idea that this video would be detrimental to the children.However,I did some homework before I had this second piece of information from the principal and had copied all of the warning labels off of the video,although it has no,um,rating.It has warning labels at least 1 on each of its volumes.I found 3 in our area.I believe there's 4,although I've never found a 4th existent.Um,so the,the labels itself made me greatly question,uh,that this teacher would,uh,bring this into the classroom.The principal also made it clear that this was not part of the curriculum,but that the teacher was trying to supplement the class and so we very respectfully,um,uh,brought in material,further material and Asked for assurance from the principal that this kind of video would not be used in the school,and the name of it was Faces of Death.It's Faces of Death,and,uh,is it a,is a kind of a movie that was shown in the theaters?No,it is a video,um,that,uh,shows,um,horrifying scenes of human beings being put to death and the actually,actually being put to death,actually being put to death.Real persons.Cameras were put on real persons during the act of being brutally put to death.The section of the video that the what does this have to do with principles of American democracy?Ah,the teacher felt it was a good,uh,video for his unit on capital punishment to show,uh,the horror of capital punishment.And so the children were,uh,subjected to watching,uh,actual executions in all sorts of,uh,forms.There were 4 different executions,and the end of the video,which was the only part that I was told was shown in the room.The the principal actually tried to justify the use of it by saying the teacher did not show the video in entirety but only showed the part on execution,which included the most gruesome,the most gruesome part.Yes,horrible things,all the volumes are horrible and,um,well,we're about out of time,Mary.We certainly do,uh,thank you for sharing this with you and alerting parents as to what kind of video their children might be shown in.In the classroom.I,I hope you are able to make sure that it won't happen again.Wow,I,uh,I find that one hard to believe.And if you have any questions or comments on this whole matter of R-rated movies being shown in the classrooms,you're certainly invited to give us a ring at 1-800-736-3202 on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [16:40.36 - 28:04.97] Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we're talking about R-rated movies in the classrooms.Can you believe some of the things we've been hearing on the phones today?How about you?Do you have any experience and do you have a question or comment for Phyllis?Well,come on in.1-800-736.3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.Let's go out to Diane in Plymouth,Michigan for Phyllis-Schlafly.Hello,Diane.Do you have a question or comment about,uh,these,the subject of classroom videos?I certainly do.Out here in Plymouth,Michigan,we have a large school system,um,the Plymouth Canton school district with the city of Canton and the city of Plymouth.We have been using R-rated movies in the classroom for a number of years.Uh,5 years ago we began an organization called Citizens for Better Education to try to combat those uses.Well,how,how much are you making?Very little.What kind of videos have been shown in the classroom?Well,um,Excalibur is one in particular that's been used for the British literature class that's rated R,that has a very graphic rape scene,and our teachers.claim that they have to show that to show how King Arthur was conceived.The scene is,uh,as nudity.Well,how,how ridiculous.Why don't they just get,uh,the children to read some of the great British literature?Well,that's not,uh,the way they're able to teach,so they claim.Well,what do they go to college and get a degree in education for if,uh,what they're going to do in the classroom is just punch up the VCR and show a video?Well,that's,that's our feelings,of course that's what we've been saying for the last few years.Well,when you complained about this particular film,Excalibur,uh,were you able to get it out?Oh,no,not at all.As a matter of fact,all,all that happened was that the school board members reviewed it.And have absolutely given it,uh,part,uh,permission to be part of the curriculum.Now there's no longer any,anything to,uh,say on the movie unless,of course we were able to change the school board.Yes,we have.Uh,4 years ago I ran for school board and I came in 2nd,so I did not,uh,gain a seat,but it was,it was a good showing,uh,to come out on this type of,you know,format.2nd year our gentleman came in 2nd again.A year later,Barbara Graham won,so she has a seat on the board,and last year we came in 2nd.But we're up against a very,um,large piece of machinery,you know.Well,I do know the National Education Association and its Michigan affiliates are very,uh,very political.Uh,they endorse candidates and they,uh,back them financially and they probably call you censors for daring to criticize the curriculum.Is that right?Well,they call us censors,they call us book burners,witch hunters.Um,you know,uh,fanatics,that sort of thing.We have all those labels.We've been carrying those for years.Well,did you have any other complaints besides Excalibur?Oh,sure,um,they're using 14 R-rated movies this semester only.14 R rated movies and what classes are they showing all these in?Certainly not all the same one.No,science fiction restarter,and The Terminator.Well,now,now wait a minute,Diane.I don't seem to know a course named Science Fiction.Is this a course taught in the schools?Phyllis They got science credit for a course in science fiction.Correct?We have science fiction and science fiction too,so we have two different classes offered.Advanced science fiction,so to speak,and they show these R rated videos in it.So what,what are the names of the films they show?All right,for the science fiction classes we show Aliens 2,Firestarter,and The Terminator.We also show Aliens,Slaughterhouse Five,and The Thing.Now it's not the same movie that was on television recently.The Thing has two different versions edited for TV and R rated.The same with Excalibur.Some people think that we're complaining about the Excalibur that was shown on television not too long ago.Was it cleaned up for television?Cleaned up dramatically for television.Uh,most individuals have never seen the movie Slaughterhouse Five,which,you know,came from a novel.And it is actual soft porn.Well,um,tell us,uh,what you've been doing to try to inform the parents about this.Uh,you said you had an organization,and,uh,are you trying to organize and clean up the,the act of the schools?We have already organized.We have 2600 people that we've identified in our community that agree with us.Um,when I say identified,it means that they have filled out a form that says that they agree with Citizens for Better Education and request the removal of R-rated movies.And the influences of the occult witchcraft and Satanism in the classroom.See,some time ago we started our journey as an organization because of the amount of witchcraft and Satanism,um,projected in our classrooms.Did they have films on the witchcraft and Satanism?Oh,absolutely.What were the names of,uh,some of those?Well,we had a six-part film clip series.It's like a,um.15 minutes each called Winnie the Witch.And that was used for 11 years in our kindergarten and 1st grade levels.And each one,each little series,um,was devoted to a topic such as friendship,um,Loving your neighbor Finding out,uh,how to deal with a bully,those were the themes,but in actuality,the way that each situation was,um,handled was by a little girl or a little witch called Winnie the Witch,and she would help this particular town that was not being led properly by the Lord.Or the Lord Mayor.And she would bring her black cat Lucifer down from Ipswich where she and and the black cat lived on the top of the hill,and the Lord Mayor would call her in for advice.He would say to the townspeople,This is too much for me.This is too much for me.I'm only a lord.I'm only the Lord Mayor.I need advice.I need help.I'll get Winnie the witch.She is so wise.Winnie would come down on her broom with her black cat Lucifer and tell the townspeople not to worry,a witch was here.And um they had to obey her because it's the law to obey witches.She would solve all the problems of the town and then at the end of the movies,the children would clap and and say,Winnie,Winnie,we love you and we want to be a witch just like you when we grow up.And this was kindergarten and first grade.We filed a complaint against that.Our school board voted unanimously to continue using the series.That was before your member got on,I guess.Yes,it was before our member got on.We began just prior to that and during that printing our own newsletter.It's very,very professionally done,and we send a copy to every resident.Well,it seems to me that with an organization of 2500 parents in one school district,uh,you should be able to have an impact on the school board,but you,they haven't listened to you,they tell you to get lost,is that it?Um,we have,we should have an impact because,you know,it's quite obvious that we have brought ourselves into some type of agreement with the folks seeing as we come in second at least each time or or else do take a seat.But there's a lot of stiff-necked individuals out this way.Well,it is extraordinary that the school board is so utterly insensitive to the desires of parents.Uh,I,in most cases,if you had an organization of that size,it seems to me you would be able to accomplish something or get them to agree that there are some parental rights out there.Well,there's a tremendous,uh,amount of hatred toward us,uh,from our local newspaper,and,uh,you have to understand this town.Has a group of people who have been the leaders for a number of years and they're just not going to listen to anybody,especially folks like us.Are you a suburb of Detroit?Yes,we are.We're about 35 miles northwest of Detroit.Well,I don't know what to suggest to you except to keep doing what you're doing and spreading the information so that ultimately the people will understand that uh uh that the schools ought to be teaching children to read and write,ought to be telling them the great things about our,our country,our government,uh,ought to be teaching them math and science and not spending time turning on videos which may be objective.Actionable in themselves and in addition to that use up time that ought to be spent on learning academic lessons did you see the Gallup poll recently,uh,put out by the National Endowment for the Humanities that showed how really ignorant,uh,uh,college seniors are about,uh,basic facts about American history and geography,and,and,uh,what's going on in our country.Well,each R-rated movie that's shown takes approximately 3 days to show in its entirety.That's 3 class periods,correct?And then,of course,it takes time to speak about it beforehand and time afterwards.So when you add that all up,you can devote a tremendous amount of the semester.Sounds about a whole week for each one almost.And,and what would you say are the classes that,uh,where these R rated videos are most frequently shown?Well,they seem they're in the,um,English department and literature,that's sort of,um,an interpersonal and our science fiction,of course.We're not talking about,um,lighthearted R-rated movies.I think that the ones that I've mentioned,I think Slaughterhouse Five,I don't believe that very many of your listeners have ever even heard of that movie or seen it.It really is a soft porn type movie.Well Diane,thank you very much for sharing this with you,with us and with our listeners.Uh,one of the purposes of this program is to let people out there across the country know what is going on.Uh,some of these tales are so incredible that if I,uh,sat at this microphone and recited them myself,people would have a hard time believing it.Uh,but when you tell us you've actually been fighting this for the last several years.And,uh,carrying on demonstrations and putting out a newsletter and still have not been able to get these videos out.I,uh,I hope that the American people will realize there is a problem.We appreciate,we appreciate your calling,Diane.We're gonna move along to another call.One minute for Tammy in Fort Walton Beach,Florida over WPSM.Tammy,what is your question or comment?We just have a minute before the break.What is your question or comment?Today,Tammy.that they will show rated movies.What is the highest grade?Uh,well,we've had,uh,we've had callers today who've said they've been showing them in,uh,9th,10th,and 11th.We've also had some of these objectionable witchcraft,uh,videos in,uh,kindergarten and 1st grade,so I think it could be any grade.No,it's apparently not against the law,and the teachers' union is trying to tell us that it is their academic freedom to show whatever they want,and parents get lost.And uh we think that uh uh the videos use up class time that belong to your lessons and uh in addition to that they should not show questionable films that are offensive to the values of the parents.How old are you,Tammy?I'm 13.Uh-huh.Have you seen,uh,what's an R rated movie?In one of your classes.Well,let's hope we keep it that way.All right,we hope you get busy and learn your lessons on the USA Radio Network.We'll be looking for your telephone call at 1-800-736-3202.We will return to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_1:** [28:07.93 - 29:07.22] Child abuse in the classroom.You've heard callers on radio live with Phyllis Schlaffly mention it many times.It is the best tool for explaining the changes that have occurred in education in the last 15 years and contains actual testimony from parents,students,and educators given at 7 regional US Department of Education hearings.Over 200,000 copies of child abuse in the classroom have been sold.Read a copy yourself and give one to a friend.Or if you want to inform those who don't have time to read,buy the video tape which is narrated by Phyllis.The best way to alert your community to the problems in the public schools is to show this video to a group of your friends.Order your copy of Eagle Forum's Child Abuse in the Classroom,the book for 495,or the video for 2195.Write Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.That address again is Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_0:** [29:21.82 - 39:05.32] Welcome back to P Phyllis-Schlafly Live on the USA Radio Network.We're hearing lots of calls from throughout America about R-rated movies in the classroom and,uh,some real eye-openers,Phyllis,and we want to get back to more.I wish somebody'd call in Bruce and say why they think R-rated movies should be shown in the classroom.I don't hear any good argument for them.Well,maybe we will before we let out here at 1-800-1-800-736-3202.Best time.To jump in is when you hear someone hang up,but right now,let's put someone on the air.It's Suzanne in Saint Louis from our flagship station KSIV.Hello Suzanne.What is your question or comment?I am grateful for this valuable.Well,thank you for listening and telling your friends.I sure will.I just have a question as a parent of two young children that haven't entered school yet.And,um,I would like to find how do we as parents find out before it happens when the class will be showing a video or a film and what will be shown,how can we find this out before it happens and the damage is done?Well,that's very hard to do and sometimes when you write a letter and notify the school they get very hostile.Uh,I would say that if I were putting a child in school,I would go and have a talk with the teacher and tell the teacher in a very nice way something.About your values and and that you are very concerned about your child and that you would like to be notified if they do anything in the uh the realm of uh videos in class or uh stories about witches or psychological uh treatment of any type or privacy invading surveys those are some of the areas that you might mention and a friendly relationship with your child's teacher would be a very good way to start.So thank you for calling Suzanne and good luck.Helen in Brownsville,New Jersey for Phyllis-Schlafly.Hello,Helen.Hi,God bless you.What is your question or comment?Well,I first want to tell you that I,I thank God that I tuned in this morning to the station.Um,this.The program that you're talking about this morning,I can't relate to it clearly because last year I started as a substitute in the area and I was sent to the special services district where basically I worked in the high school with um emotionally disturbed teenagers and every time I went into work I went.Determined to teach something and each time I was given a video to show them,and most of the videos were rated R or PG-13,and some of the scenes were really inappropriate.Uh,this is for emotionally disturbed teenagers.And at first I felt really uncomfortable sitting there watching these movies with them,but I felt as a substitute teacher in a,in a district.Which I weren't,wasn't familiar with anybody that I wasn't in a position to argue or stir up any kind of friction.Well,as a substitute teacher,did you have some training for dealing with emotionally disturbed children?Well,they gave us 3 or 4 days orientation.Basically you go in and they kind of ask you to just watch the situations and if there's any trouble,they have a special phone and you call and they come in.Well,you were not,you,you were not a licensed psychologist,right?And,but yet you were assigned to deal with,uh,some particular teenagers who'd been taken out of class as emotionally disturbed,right?Some of them were had serious problems.Some of them,we had one student who was,um,a professed Satan worshiper,and,um,he's in jail now for a crime he committed,and there were other students who were just ticking time bombs.Do you have the names of any videos that you showed?Um,some of the videos I can't remember right now clearly,but I remember,um.But were any of them violent films?Some of them were,yes.Oh,you know,detective.How shocking to show a film with violence to emotionally disturbed teenagers.I know,and,and you felt in with your status as a substitute teacher that it was not wise for you to make a fuss about it.Is that it?Right,exactly.I hope that by listening to this program,ah,other people will discover what is going on and maybe they'll be able to look into it,right,because it's really a shame that it's going on,period,in any schools,but particularly when you have a special school like this with children with special needs,you know,that these types of movies shouldn't be seen.Not even wasting time,particularly on a PG movie,because these children,the academic levels are usually much lower than your typical student,so they,you know,they need the extra help in academics and they shouldn't really be wasting time watching movies.Well,thank you very much for your insight,Helen.We appreciate your call and we move on to Bensalem,Pennsylvania over WCHR.Here's Francis Phyllis.Hello,Francis.What is your question or comment?Uh,my comment is,um,that I was thinking about what if the people pick up the schools and bring it to the news media so that they would pick it up.And give it a more wide known spectrum.I think that's a very good idea.I can't tell you that it's always going to be successful because it's my understanding.What it's worth a try.It's worth a try.There,there are some people in the Detroit area who did that recently and they had some very good signs.Uh,but,uh,you know how the television is.If you create a media event with,as they say,visuals and,uh,and signs that lend themselves to the 2 2nd sound bites,then maybe you can call public attention to what is going on.I think that's a very excellent suggestion.Have you had any,uh,firsthand experience with these videos in the classroom?Uh,no,I haven't,and this is the first time I've ever heard you on the radio,and I don't know,maybe it's just meant for me to hear this,but,um,the only thing that I can really think back on is when my daughter was,um,I believe it was in her health class,and she said something about that they were going to show a movie,and I questioned it and I called the school and I was told that.Uh,because I was asking if I could be there to see it so that I could talk to my daughter about it afterwards,and I was told that it would be better if I would,if I was not there because the discussion after the movie,the kids would not feel free to talk about it if I was there.What was the name of the film?Uh,I don't remember.All I know is it was a sex education,uh,movie,and I think it was the one.Uh,where it,it shows the beginning of birth,and they've showed it on Channel 12 on that educational program.I think that's the same one that they saw.Well,I think you should have been allowed to be there,but in any event,if they wouldn't do that,you should have been allowed to preview it ahead of time.Time so you could either keep your child out or warn her or discuss it with her,and we thank you very much for calling in.We're going to go to another call,but we appreciate your interest.In Port Washington,New York.Here's Liz Phyllis.Hello,Liz.Phyllis.What is your question or comment?Well,I just wanted to,um,um,let you know about,uh,a situation with regards to,uh,films dealing with teenage suicide,ah,which was a topic that,uh,my husband and I.Um,became aware of during the course of a conversation with,um,my son's,um,junior high school teachers when we had gone to meet with them,um,simply to discuss his,uh,academic,um,Uh,program,and,um,by accident the,um,the subject of,uh,the showing of a teenage,uh,uh,suicide film,uh,was mentioned by one of the teachers voluntarily just,uh,offhandedly,um,and this was,uh,a surprise to me,and,uh,I asked the,the,um,the teacher if I could,uh,view the films,and she had said that what she had done was she had copied them on her VCR from.Um,regular broadcast television,and then she had used them in the classroom.And,uh,my husband and I,we both,uh,looked at the,at the films,and my personal feeling was that,uh,well,the content of the film dealt with teenagers who were,um,licensed drivers,so they had to be at least 16 years of age because they were able to drive cars because the method for suicide in both films was,uh,to use their cars.Um,my son,of course,at that point was in 7th grade,and I felt that,uh,well,at least the method was something that these,uh,uh,children couldn't use because it was beyond them.They just simply didn't have the,the legal.Uh,right to,to drive a car,but,uh,my,uh,feeling was that what had been,um,shown was suggestive and the,the idea had been,uh,planted and that,um,that the kids,uh,down the line once they did have their licenses,the possibility was that maybe,uh,subconsciously this would have an effect on them.Well,when you say the car was used as the vehicle,I suppose you mean the carbon monoxide.Ah,we're out of time,Liz.Ah,how about standing by till after the announcements,and we'd like to finish up with this conversation.Um,one of those,uh,network shows caused a lot of suicides just by its showing,so we'll talk about it a little more in a minute.1-800-736-3202 is our telephone number.Another segment to come on Philly Schlafly Live.

**spk_3:** [43:51.61 - 44:25.64] I have one comment,and then the other question is,it doesn't necessarily have just to do with,uh,uh,films shown in school but just what's shown on the,uh,network.Uh,one,the comment I'd like to make is I haven't heard many men as itself,calling into the station about attention shown to films in school or on television or voicing their comments.I myself feel that I'm just as much as responsible for the children that I raised in the household here and wondering why we haven't heard many comments from the men itself.

**spk_0:** [44:25.80 - 44:29.16] Well,I don't know,but I'm glad you called in,Bruce.So give us your comment.

**spk_3:** [44:29.81 - 44:52.30] I feel that myself that I'm just as much as totally responsible as being the figure holding the household about the children being raised and what they see and how they're raised.I believe that's what God,one reason why God put me on earth,I'm responsible.I believe that the men as well should be calling in and voicing their opinion and standing up for what their children are watching on.in the schools.

**spk_0:** [44:52.34 - 49:22.16] Absolutely,but the first thing,the first thing you have to find out is what are the children getting in the schools,so you should have a daily conversation with your children to find out so that you know and you stay on top of it and also talk to the teachers so that you can,uh,find,uh,what's coming up in the next few weeks.Well,I congratulate you on your good approach to this,and we appreciate your call,and I hope we will have more men.And let's go out to Doylestown,Pennsylvania.Here's Michelle over at WCHR.Phyllis.Hello,Michelle.What is your question or comment?Well,I want to say I,I'm a former public school teacher,a Christian school teacher as well.Of elementary students and,and I'm amazed at the amount of time that is wasted on films and videos that are really non-educational.That's what gets me too,Michelle.Why,why aren't they learning the great things that need to be taught in schools?There are so many things.I mean,kids get bombarded with video and television when they're at home anyway,um,but my main point is that parents,parents have got to be encouraged to get in that classroom and see exactly what's going on,make a nuisance of themselves if they have to.Um,my children will not be in public school because I was a public school teacher and I know what goes on,and I am in that classroom.Weeks on end without the principal coming in to see me or anybody else.And I'm a Christian,so I do things that are proper in a classroom,but what about all of those that are not?I know we had,um,one in my school district that was a hypnotist.Now,does that philosophy come through to her children?I don't know.I,I know you mean the public,the public school teacher was a hypnotist.That's right.Now my values and my morals came through to my students,and I did that purposely because I'm a born again Christian.But I also know that those who are not send their values through to their children also.That's right.Children are going to get values no matter what.The question is whose values are they going to get.So we thank you,Michelle,for calling this to our attention.We have time,I think,for one more quick call.Um.Fred in Saint Louis over KSIV.Hello,Fred.Hello,Phyllis.How are you?What is your question or comment?Well,I'm in favor of these.R rated movies in the classroom.You are,which ones in particular are you in favor of?Well,I,I haven't,uh,I can't give you a list,but I think in general life itself is R rated.There's going to be sex.There's going to be violence.It's going to be bad language,and the classroom is a good place to discuss it.Well,don't you think a classroom would be a good place to teach children the good things about life?Well,that's all part of it too.Well,you,uh,there's a lot of disease out in the world that some of us haven't had,and we don't need to get started in the classroom.In fact,we may never have some of those diseases or engage in some of that bad language.But it's,uh,it's just a part of a well-rounded education.Well.Well,maybe,maybe we can.All right,well,the children will,I think what I think is the children can get that on TV every night.All of our,uh,all of our information shows that the children are spending more time watching television anyway,and they can get that on television.They don't need it in the classroom.Did,did you take us on a break,Phyllis?Thank you very much for the telephone calls.We do have some closing comments to come from Phyllis,so stay with us on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.America's child care issue is of utmost importance today.Eagle-Forum now offers you vital information on the child care issue.The book Who Will Rock the Cradle is must reading if you have preschool children.Who will rock the cradle?Will it be the government or the family?Learn about all the aspects of the child care issue from nationally recognized experts.After you read Who Will Rock the Cradle,you'll have enough authoritative,quotable material to write a letter to your representatives or editors every day for the next year.Plus,Who Will Rock the Cradle has powerful information to persuade young parents to give their children the most precious gift of all mother care.Who will rock the cradle is available to you.Just send 1495 postpaid to Eagle-Forum.That's Eagle like the American eagle,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.

**spk_0:** [50:24.12 - 51:22.56] I think our last caller really pointed up what the problem is.There are a lot of people out there who think that schoolchildren in the classroom should be shown violence,explicit sex,immoral sex,and all kinds of bad language and other things that parents may not approve of.If that's not your point of view,you better look into what is being shown in the public school classroom because a lot of R-rated movies,a lot of very immoral bad language movies are using up class time.And uh after all,what are we paying the teachers for?We're teaching them to teach academic lessons,not to punch up a video.Tune in again next week.We'd like to hear from you.Phyllis-Schlafly Live on parents' rights and education presented by the USA Radio Network and by Eagle-Forum,a leading pro-family organization since 1972.Stay informed on what the public schools are teaching our children with Phyllis-Schlafly Live on parents' rights and education.
