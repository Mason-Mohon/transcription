**spk_0:** [00:01.34 - 00:09.59] This is Phyllis Schlaffly live by tape recording to be aired on September 9th,and it's coming in 32,1.

**spk_1:** [00:10.48 - 00:20.00] Some public schools have subjected the children to a depressing course in nuclear war,and this has filled the children with guilt,fear,and even despair.

**spk_0:** [00:22.16 - 00:47.24] Welcome to Philly Schlafly Live.I'm Bruce Hayes.Today we'll discuss one of the most controversial courses taught in public schools today,those courses on nuclear war.You know,some people think these courses are not designed to present historical facts and Information at all but are designed to implant certain attitudes in the schoolchildren.Stay tuned and we'll talk about it with Phyllis-Schlafly and her guests in the studio.

**spk_1:** [00:47.60 - 02:09.54] The problem with nuclear war courses came home to me a couple of years ago when I was traveling through Ohio and a mother showed me the note that was written by her 4th grade child.This note,complete with misspellings and bad grammar,read like this Dear President Reagan,I don't know if I'm stupid or not.Are we going to have World War II?My mom says she hopes not.My teacher at school says she is certain that we are.Well,personally,I don't want it neither,but I know we are.How pitiful that that 4th grade child was told by her teacher that we are going to have World War 3.The courses on nuclear war fill children with all kinds of fear for the future.When ABC put on its big program on teenage suicide just before the teenagers committed suicide with carbon monoxide,one of them said,It doesn't matter what we do,the whole world's going to blow up anyway.And then there was that case in a Pennsylvania school where the principal conducted a psychological experiment.He announced on the intercom that the Soviets had bombed a US ship in the Baltic Sea,and he dismissed everybody early.They were all frightened.It was a complete falsehood,but he called it an exercise in analytical thinking,and everybody was very scared.

**spk_0:** [02:10.38 - 02:21.87] Phyllis,before we do go to our studio guest,I want to talk more on.This matter and I'm sure you do with Mrs.Marilyn Shannon from Salem,Oregon.She's a legislative assistant to a state senator out there.

**spk_1:** [02:22.18 - 02:30.97] Maryland had experience with the one state that has mandated a course in nuclear war in the public schools.Are you there,Marilyn?

**spk_2:** [02:31.18 - 02:31.62] Yes,I am.

**spk_1:** [02:31.78 - 02:37.18] So far as I know,you're the only state that did this,Oregon.Tell us how it happened.Well,

**spk_2:** [02:38.06 - 03:24.69] a representative wanted this,and He lobbied it through the education committees,and it passed the House by one vote.It was a very close vote and then and it mandated this curriculum be written and then when they developed the curriculum,I would say that it also the state Board of Education adopted what they had developed by just one simple vote and I have a copy of the curriculum,and I thought it was interesting what Bruce said.It was not designed to To present historical facts because right here in the forward that's exactly what it says.It's designed to help students better understand cultural differences,to evaluate ideas,make decisions,communicate effectively,and participate in events that affect our future as a society.

**spk_1:** [03:25.27 - 03:33.57] Did you see evidence,Marilyn,that this legislation was pushed by that special interest group called Educators for Social Responsibility?

**spk_2:** [03:34.13 - 03:39.21] I,I did not see that,but somebody was pushing it.It wasn't the,the,the,uh,it didn't

**spk_1:** [03:39.21 - 03:39.73] just happen.

**spk_2:** [03:39.93 - 03:49.53] No,it didn't just happen,and I,I,OEA,which is an arm of NEA,was not pushing it.It was not something they wanted.It was one special interest group that did want it.

**spk_1:** [03:49.69 - 04:07.21] The educators for social responsibility have bragged in their fundraising letters.That they've been pushing for state legislative mandates of nuclear war courses and then when the mandate is passed,then they turn up with a ready-made curriculum.Well,what happened after your bill was passed?

**spk_2:** [04:07.28 - 04:51.82] Well,after the bill was passed and the bill said that they had to report back to the next session of the legislature,which would be the one that just adjourned.They,uh,in the interim,interim they set up a,a,uh,this curriculum committee made up of people that were for a strong defense and people that were for total disarmament,and I talked to some people that served on the committee and they said the saddest thing is the real facts on both ends of the spectrum are not in this curriculum and are not represented at all because it was so objectionable to the other side and they felt that it.It was almost a,uh,you know,exercise in futility because what did come out didn't really give the hard reasons for disarmament or the hard reasons for a strong defense.

**spk_1:** [04:52.22 - 05:00.99] Well,you have these,the peace activists,the disarmament activists who've been pushing this,and that's what they really want to get in the curriculum,isn't it?

**spk_2:** [05:01.22 - 05:25.83] Oh,I,I,I,that's my opinion.And also I talked to somebody from the Department of Education.They said not one school district called.You know,and has been wanting this,and you know,when will it be ready,and thank you,we've been able to use it,he said unfortunately I think it was mailed out to the school districts and it's just sitting in some library someplace because there really isn't a,it's not something that the actual day to day teachers that would use it want.

**spk_1:** [05:25.91 - 05:27.53] Well,the schools didn't really want it.

**spk_2:** [05:27.71 - 05:31.27] No,absolutely they didn't.They don't want the state to mandate anything else.

**spk_1:** [05:31.59 - 05:38.48] Well,the states in many states have been mandating all sorts of non-academic courses.Um,but this was

**spk_2:** [05:38.48 - 05:46.88] not mandated.It's just there if they want to use it.That the school's administrators did win on this one.They said,you develop it.Don't mandate that we teach it,

**spk_1:** [05:46.96 - 05:48.71] so the schools do not have to use it.

**spk_2:** [05:48.88 - 05:49.11] They do

**spk_1:** [05:49.11 - 05:52.30] not,and the children do not have to take it.It's just there.

**spk_2:** [05:52.43 - 06:07.51] It's just there it was just spending taxpayers' money because no,uh,this,uh,what you just mentioned that for,um,social res educators for social responsibility they didn't fund any of this.It was all funded at taxpayers' expense and probably will not be used a great deal.

**spk_1:** [06:08.28 - 06:32.43] Well,thank you for telling us about that,Marilyn.If you could stand by,we're going to introduce our guest in the studio today who is Dr.Francis Shands,a professor of education at St.Louis University.Welcome,Dr.Shandz.Glad to have you.I'm glad to be here.I understand you've recently returned from one of these conferences put on by the people who want to put nuclear war and peace education in the schools.Is that right?

**spk_3:** [06:32.72 - 06:41.14] That's right.They were mostly junior college and college educators,but they were a sampling from all around the country of people who are teaching this kind of course.

**spk_1:** [06:41.42 - 06:45.20] Are they definitely pushing to get these courses in the schools?

**spk_3:** [06:45.50 - 06:47.65] Oh,absolutely,yes,that's what they want.

**spk_1:** [06:47.79 - 06:58.64] And give us an overview of what type of a course they see as what they want to achieve.Is it,is it a course that that peddles the line that disarmament is the route to peace?

**spk_3:** [06:59.32 - 07:34.80] Yes,disarmament is one of the things that they're working for,but they're doing this in a very subtle kind of a way.They're trying to,to,uh,seek to get people more interested in how the Soviet people live and the kinds of things they do.And the curriculum turns out to be things like,uh,learning how to bake Russian tea cakes and learning to sing Russian folk songs and there are a lot of things like telecommunications,uh,where our students are beamed by satellite over to the,uh,Soviet students and they communicate and talk about common problems and,and so forth.

**spk_1:** [07:35.04 - 07:52.88] Would you say that they are.Promoting what Ambassador Kirkpatrick has called the myth of equivalence,that is,the people in the Soviet Union are just like we are in the United States and we have the same hopes and desires,and they're very nice people,and if we would just get to know them,that the world would be a much better place.

**spk_3:** [07:53.23 - 07:58.39] Absolutely.In fact,that was stated very explicitly in the conference that I went to.

**spk_1:** [07:58.94 - 08:18.30] Well,the courses in nuclear war that were developed about 5 years ago were very depressing.They,they spent long hours of taking the children through grim tales of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.And are they still promoting that type of education?

**spk_3:** [08:18.72 - 08:58.58] The general agreement seemed to be among the people that I heard talking there was that those things kind of fell dead.They were so dull and so depressing teachers didn't even want to use them.And so I think that's really a step in the right direction.So that's why they've taken this new turn to talk about the commonalities that we have with the Soviet people and how wonderful they are and And how we should use methods like conflict resolution,and this is supposed to help people solve their problems not by warlike things but,um,by,uh,getting along with each other and accommodating to these Russian people who are really very,very nice and.Trying to be democratic and so forth.

**spk_1:** [08:58.85 - 09:12.32] Well,Dr.Shands,you have your degree in education,I think,from,uh,you have your doctorate from my alma mater,Washington University.Now you tell us what the educators mean when they talk about conflict resolution in the public school classroom.

**spk_3:** [09:13.10 - 10:15.32] Well,let me give you an example.One of the first exercises for the children to do is to,um,close their eyes and imagine that they're having a terrible fight with one of their friends and they're very angry at each other,and at a classmate perhaps,and ask,and then they're supposed to think,how could we solve this without really saying bad words to each other and without hitting each other?And so then,I mean,that's the first step that's trying to create a mindset.Of,of not fighting,not standing up for things,it's,it's kind of,um.I call it emasculation of the,uh,American public,you know,young boys at an early age are supposed to think about,uh,being uh having a male role,and little girls are supposed to be thinking about,uh,having a female role.But with this new conflict resolution idea,nobody's supposed to take a strong stand on anything.You're supposed to accommodate to what the other person wants,and therefore there'll be peace in the world.

**spk_1:** [10:15.56 - 10:32.99] There is some merit in the idea that you shouldn't be hitting each other and you should try to get along,be civilized,and be polite,but to translate that into thinking that that type of behavior is going to enable us to get along with the Soviet Union with their missile arsenal.It is pretty ridiculous,isn't it?

**spk_3:** [10:33.29 - 11:05.82] I agree with you,and the thing that bothers me is that the Soviet children are given an entirely different kind of a curriculum.Um,if you could see some pictures that Leon Gore sent me of the first grade readers that the Rusn children have,they learn their ABC's by seeing pictures of little boys carrying guns marching across the room and little girls carrying stretchers.Um,first grade,here they are thinking about war already.And uh but our society isn't supposed to think about anything like that.We're not supposed to think

**spk_1:** [11:05.82 - 11:07.02] they're very peace loving.

**spk_3:** [11:07.32 - 11:08.49] That's right.Well,

**spk_1:** [11:08.60 - 11:20.83] tell me at this conference,did,did you get a feeling that these educators on nuclear war and peace are really after teaching attitudinal change rather than knowledge and facts?

**spk_3:** [11:21.24 - 11:51.35] Oh,absolutely.That was the whole point.In fact,one of the most applauded speakers was a man who was,uh,showing how he had changed the attitude in his class that he had on nuclear war,and,um,the beginning attitude was 75% felt that the Soviets couldn't be trusted to,um,live up to a peace treaty or a peace agreement.And by the end of the course that attitude had changed where only 30% felt that way,and he felt very successful and people applauded him.

**spk_1:** [11:51.64 - 11:58.54] The,uh,those figures that you just quoted,uh,I assume that's the result of what the educators call pre and post testing.

**spk_3:** [11:58.63 - 12:05.55] Oh yes,that was the pre and post test.He didn't use.Any factual materials,it's a fact-free curriculum.It's an attitude curriculum.

**spk_1:** [12:05.87 - 12:22.87] I wonder if they're showing pictures of smiling Mike Gorbachev on television.He's supposed to be a,a Democrat who shakes hands and campaigns like,uh,uh,candidates do in this country.And the whole idea is to teach children that there isn't any threat from the Soviet Union.

**spk_3:** [12:23.03 - 12:33.58] That's right.Uh,they don't talk about the whole division of tanks that the Soviets are producing every month.That just doesn't creep into the curriculum at all.It's ignored.

**spk_1:** [12:33.71 - 12:46.23] Well,don't you think that the American students need to have some real facts about what is in the Soviet arsenal and what weapons they have that have no other utility than killing Americans?

**spk_3:** [12:47.03 - 13:05.25] That's right.You know that,that brings me back to what Marilyn was saying.I,I talked to Marilyn about,uh,what went on in Oregon.And one of their,um,educators from the State Department said the most wonderful thing.Marilyn,do you remember when we were talking last night that I would you tell the audience about that?I thought it was so exciting.Well,

**spk_2:** [13:05.26 - 13:24.22] I kind of did in the opening,and that was that the,the,the best facts were not presented because the other side found them so objectionable.The,the best,uh,reasons to deploy SDI,the Strategic Defense Initiative,and those things were not in there because the other side.Uh,didn't,you know,didn't approve,

**spk_3:** [13:24.64 - 13:30.16] but that educator said,wouldn't it have been wonderful if we had had both sides,go ahead,

**spk_2:** [13:30.35 - 13:44.35] yeah,he said it would have been better if we had had both sides,uh,give their best shot and be able to put it in the curriculum what they felt and then let the children decide.Let them decide what they think is true.Do you know,

**spk_3:** [13:44.44 - 14:04.38] I think that man ought to be Secretary of Education.I was so excited when you told me about that last night.You know,just think how much fun it would be to teach a course like this,say,for 7th and 8th and 9th graders,and just think about all the parents who would be home prepping their little Johnnies and Janies to talk about their sides of the issues.It could be terribly exciting.

**spk_1:** [14:04.60 - 14:13.12] Well,it's the American way to think that when you have strong advocates on both sides of an issue,then justice is better served.and truth is better served.

**spk_3:** [14:13.37 - 14:19.40] That's right.We have a free market economy for food and goods.Why not have a free market economy for ideas,

**spk_0:** [14:19.51 - 14:32.64] ladies?This is where I'm going to have to jump in,and we're finding out some eye-opening information on courses on nuclear war taught in the public schools.Stay with us on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [16:46.31 - 16:50.43] And welcome back to Phyllis-Schlafly Live on the USA Radio Network.

**spk_1:** [16:50.59 - 18:52.65] It was about 5 years ago that several special interest groups developed courses on nuclear war.One of them was called Decision Making in a Nuclear Age.Another was called Crossroads.Another was called A Day of Dialogue,which was written by the Educators for Social Responsibility.And then there was one called Choices,which was developed by the National Education Association,the NEA.It was used in thousands of classrooms.The Eagle-Forum did a survey and analysis of these courses,which is still a definitive piece on what's wrong with them.Let me read you a couple of quotations that were written by students who took these courses.One of them said,I am very scared,very,very scared.Because with a nuclear war you don't have a chance to survive.Another one wrote,These days I just try hard not to think about my future because I have a hard time seeing one.There aren't any jobs and there isn't any money for me to go to college,but who cares about me?Besides,we're all going to get blown up anyway.Another one wrote,Some of the discussions we had got pretty heavy,and it was hard to handle.It's hard to spend 45 minutes a day talking about dying,and it's depressing too.Several students began to cry.No,no!they yelled.We'll all be dead.It's no use.We're doomed.Well,I think that those courses didn't sell very well.Dr.Shand,as you found out in this conference you just went to,the teachers who were promoting these courses and the special interest groups that were selling them found that the children just couldn't take this type of a depressing approach.So now they have a new approach which you told us a little bit about,but tell us a little bit more about what their new strategy is to put the same attitudinal change process in the classroom without scaring them to death about extended films and discussions of what happens in a nuclear attack.

**spk_3:** [18:53.77 - 19:47.89] Well,I think that,um,you might look at some of the materials that are put out by the Center for Teaching International Relations.It's,uh,at the University of Denver,and,uh,they have a lot of new materials that are being put out,um,but really they're not talking so much about the depressing side of it anymore.They're really talking about,um,things like,uh,contamination of the,uh,atmosphere and so forth and how we can do something about it.And,uh,it's,it's just amazing how this whole thrust towards,um,conservation in this way and cleaning up the atmosphere is,uh,the same kind of thing that,uh,Mikhail Gorbachev is talking about,you know,Mikhail,if you would close your eyes and listen to one of his speeches,it sounds exactly like the kind of stuff that's coming out of CTIR,uh,uh,that's the Center for Teaching International Relations don't you.

**spk_1:** [19:47.99 - 19:58.69] I think they tend to confuse for the children the difference between a nuclear energy which produces electricity and nuclear weapons which are designed to kill us.They're not the same thing.

**spk_3:** [19:59.07 - 20:05.44] That's right,and I think we need to have some clarification out in our schools on what's the difference between those two.

**spk_1:** [20:05.76 - 20:15.09] Now in your work in education,I understand you have developed a study guide or a curriculum on these issues,and what approach have you taken?

**spk_3:** [20:15.86 - 21:12.12] Well,I've,uh,taken the approach that,um,the kids ought to be able to to decide about these issues,and that's why I was so excited when Marilyn talked about how that educator perceived that and said,gee,if only we had developed a curriculum giving both sides and so that's what I've tried to do with a new curriculum that I've just written and um.Uh,I've,I've even advocated that,uh,the teachers when they try to start teaching something like this,bring the parents in the first day of school and say,look,this is what I want to do.I want to give your kids a chance to learn about what's going on in the world,and we're going to look at both sides of the issues.So I want you to help me by talking about the current news issues with your children over the breakfast table or over the dinner table at night and maybe you could tape some good programs on,um,television when they come in and let your children listen to them and I'll play them here in class and age.

**spk_1:** [21:12.38 - 21:13.45] Are we talking about?

**spk_3:** [21:13.91 - 21:42.44] Well,I think that,uh,grades 7 through 12 are really the best ages to,to pick up on something like this.7th,8th,and 9th grade is a wonderful age,Phyllis,because that's when kids first get the idea that that they have something to say about what's going on in the world.They can have an impact about what's going on,and they,they like to take up a cause at that age.And if you can get them.Interested in world affairs,then you've got them for the rest of their lives.It can be very exciting.

**spk_1:** [21:42.49 - 22:01.71] Well,one of the problems with the teaching is telling children of this age,we're talking about 1112,13 years old,telling them they're capable of making great decisions of war and peace when they really don't have the information on which to base such a decision.

**spk_3:** [22:02.09 - 22:04.21] Well,that's why I like my books so much.

**spk_1:** [22:04.67 - 22:04.92] Why is

**spk_3:** [22:04.92 - 22:05.12] your

**spk_1:** [22:05.12 - 22:05.64] book good?

**spk_3:** [22:06.64 - 22:42.63] Because it,it gives a database for the children so that they can,um,understand what are some of the key facts on both sides of these issues,and then they really can carry on a dialogue about,you know,what these issues are and,and it takes the first baby steps for these children to be able to talk about and debate with fellow classmates so that when they grow up and they get in college and they graduate from.College,they can be state legislators and they can be national legislators and they can,they've had that experience in their background so that they know they have the capability to talk and people will listen.Well,

**spk_1:** [22:42.72 - 23:02.69] do you give them,for example,the facts about the Soviet military arsenal and how even if Gorbachev cuts back so many of his missiles as they are talking about in some of these treaty negotiations.He's still going to have far more than we have and plenty to be able to destroy us.

**spk_3:** [23:03.05 - 23:17.01] Yes,and,uh,I think you've got to think about all the things that are hidden too.If he,if he cuts back on a lot of things,he's still going to have all those mobile missiles floating around somewhere hidden under trees and so forth,uh,way out of Siberia and that

**spk_1:** [23:17.01 - 23:34.83] vast expanse of land in Siberia,there is,there is no way to find all the mobile missiles.That's right.Also,do you tell them in your course about the,the failure of treaties and how the Soviet Union has the worst record as a treaty breaker in all history?

**spk_3:** [23:35.29 - 23:53.97] Yes,that's one of the things we talk about,but I also talk about the other side too,you know,some of the benefits that could come from this,you know.From what from having treaties with the Soviets,the only thing that concerns me is if we do have treaties,we ought to have a backup in case they do cheat on a treaty.They,

**spk_1:** [23:54.38 - 24:12.19] well,do you think we should expect them to keep the treaty in the face of their record of treaty breaking?The only treaty they really kept was the one they made with Hitler.And uh it,it's a question of whether we put our reliance on treaties or our reliance on our own national defense.

**spk_3:** [24:12.82 - 24:43.25] Well,I think that we can have the best of two worlds.I mean,that's my own opinion.I,I think the kids are going to have to decide about this.But if we got something like the Strategic Defense Initiative,for example,that,um,if they had cheated on the treaties,uh,there would be our,our,uh,7000 satellites floating around.Equipped with stinger missiles that could shoot down a missile should they,should they start an attack,and then we wouldn't have to worry if,if they cheated on the treaty,right?

**spk_1:** [24:43.38 - 24:54.38] I assume you tell them that that the Strategic Defense Initiative or SDI can't kill anybody.It can only kill missiles,which is another large area of confusion.

**spk_3:** [24:54.50 - 25:36.36] A lot of people think that it.It's going to take nuclear war to space,and,and really these,uh,these aren't even weapons.Uh,they can't hurt anybody.They,they are kinetic energy weapons,and nobody understands that kinetic energy is kind of like the caveman used to do when he threw rocks,and these are smart rocks up in the sky,and they have a little computer brain on them and uh.sensing,they're not nuclear.They don't even have a TNT or any kind of explosion in them.They,they stop the missiles just by getting in their way,and the missile's force,um,causes itself to explode,you know,they have very thin skin,so they just fall apart.Then it's the high velocity that

**spk_1:** [25:36.36 - 26:05.48] does the job.Most of the nuclear war courses that were developed a few years ago.Had the effect on the students of persuading them that the United States was primarily responsible for conflict and the Cold War and that the Soviets were justified in building up their force because they're afraid of us.I assume you'd give the students the real facts that it is the Soviets who have carried out surprise attacks against other countries,and the United States doesn't do that.

**spk_3:** [26:06.19 - 26:15.73] Well,I,I can't think of any case that the United States has ever done that.No,it is the Soviets.The Soviets moved into Afghanistan without any provocation at all.

**spk_1:** [26:16.15 - 26:40.27] So the point of your curriculum is that you set the children up to see both sides.In other words,it's not a brainwashing indoctrination type of course.It's not designed.To change their attitudes toward predetermined goals,but it is designed to set up a pro and con so that they can have a useful classroom discussion with the fair arguments on both sides.

**spk_3:** [26:40.39 - 27:26.90] That's right.You know what worries me most about American education is that we're not producing any lech valences.You know,he came from a working class family.But he is,uh,he learned the skills of talking and leading and,and he was a thinker and an understander.We're not producing people like that in our society,and it really disturbs me and I feel that my curriculum would be such a great,um,addition to,to the whole US society to get to start making thinkers and talkers and and arguers and debaters and when these issues out on the table,well,um.I think that it will be ready for the spring term.I think that the publisher has told me that we can get it ready for the spring term.Well,

**spk_1:** [27:26.94 - 27:40.24] if any of our listeners are interested in getting this curriculum,you can contact us.Uh,we would want children to be taught the facts,the history.and have the knowledge on which they can make informed decisions.

**spk_0:** [29:34.79 - 29:45.51] From the USA Radio Network,welcome back to Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we're talking about nuclear war courses.Phyllis,let's go right to your next guest from Higgam,Massachusetts.Here's Susan Marshall.

**spk_1:** [29:45.63 - 30:02.07] Hello,Susan.Hi P Phyllis.We've been talking in the studio with Dr.Francis Shands,who's a professor of education at St.Louis University and has a lot.Experience about these nuclear war courses,but I understand you had an incident in your area,and I'd like you to tell our listeners about it.

**spk_6:** [30:02.21 - 32:13.55] Well,it was really extraordinary in a town called Stoughton,Massachusetts,which was just one of the school districts that a group of Japanese atomic blast survivors visited.Uh,children in the junior high school there,637 of them to be exact,were,uh,herded into the school auditorium,unbeknownst to their parents,by the way,to hear two full hours of the most extraordinary.Terrifying and gory stories of life at Ground Zero in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the moments following the detonation of those atomic bombs.And after the presentation,the children were interviewed by the Patriot Ledger newspaper and asked about their responses to the presentation.Some of the interesting things that were presented to the children other than the,the extremely gory details.Of dead babies with their skin falling off,of bloated bodies,of people burned walking up and down,also with their skin falling off,people with dismembered,uh,relatives finding their dismembered relatives in,in the rubble and so on and so forth.Uh,one of the Japanese,uh,survivors told of her sister who had been,uh,somewhat disfigured in the blast by the fire,who shortly thereafter committed suicide.Because she was no longer acceptable to her friends because she had been disfigured and one of the comments that one of the young people made after the,uh,presentation to a reporter was that she too would commit suicide under those circumstances.So not only did we have the children,uh,terrorized.And asking the survivors to please forgive the United States for having dropped this bomb on them and doing that to their families.But we had the kids thinking that the only alternative in those situations would be simply to kill themselves.

**spk_1:** [32:13.97 - 32:19.40] And these presentations were made by 2 Japanese who speak English,correct?4.There is a,yes,

**spk_6:** [32:19.49 - 32:57.44] and that was greeted by the Massachusetts legislature before they,uh,commenced their tour of school districts in the state.And one of the legislatures,it was subsequently reported in the Boston Herald by columnist Howie Carr,went to the Japanese survivors and asked them to forgive the United States for having dropped that bomb,and then of course they proceeded to give their same presentation to the school districts and the children were encouraged similarly.To ask forgiveness.

**spk_1:** [32:57.76 - 33:20.65] Well,that comment brings up one of the points that I have always believed is one of the purposes of these courses,and that is to make the United States feel very guilty for dropping the atom bomb.And I don't suppose they talked about the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor or any of the death marches carried out by the Japanese against American.Prisoners or anything like that.Oh,

**spk_6:** [33:20.81 - 33:25.22] absolutely no history is taught prior to the presentation whatsoever.

**spk_1:** [33:25.30 - 33:28.29] And were any parents advised in advance that this would happen?

**spk_6:** [33:28.63 - 34:24.79] No,no.As a matter of fact,uh,what,what,what I thought was,was quite astounding was that subsequent to the presentation at the school where,as I said,there were 637 captive children listening,um,the same people gave a presentation in a local church,which was,uh.Uh,announced in the newspapers and only 37 adults showed up from the whole community,um,and the surrounding communities.so where these people could not seem to generate interest in their particular message in the adult community,what they do is go into the schools and give it to the captive children and without any,any rationalization whatsoever for the,uh,circumstances involved in the in the bombing,the fact that 1.5 million people would have died without the bombing.In other words,because the war would have dragged on many more years and so on and so forth.

**spk_1:** [34:25.03 - 34:49.57] That's correct.And if anybody in your family was an American GI on the West Coast or in the Pacific or Alaska in 1945,ready to be sent to Japan for an island by island hand combat at an official estimated cost of 1 million American casualties,I can tell you that all those men were very.Happy that the atom bomb ended the war.

**spk_6:** [34:49.85 - 35:15.93] My father,as a matter of fact,was one of those people.My father was an underwater demolition expert in the Navy and a Navy frogman and was scheduled.He was a little bit younger,so,uh,didn't go into the war,as soon as it began because he was still in high school.But getting on into the war,he was drafted into the Navy after having been in the defense industry,as a matter of fact,and was scheduled to be shipped to the West Coast to go overseas just before that happened.

**spk_1:** [35:16.49 - 35:20.81] Well,was there any protest by the parents after this happened at the school?

**spk_6:** [35:21.09 - 36:20.99] Well,as a matter of fact,the parents really didn't,didn't know about it.The only way we found out about it.Through this report in the newspaper and that was not my community.I did not,uh,follow up on the activities of the parents in that community after it happened,although I did,um,subsequently speak to Howie Carr,the,uh,columnist for the Boston Herald and did send him the information of what happened and he he included that in his column because responsible people in the state were were just amazed that this could be first of all done to children to be ter to terrorize in that way and that members The state legislature had asked these had presumed to take it upon themselves to ask these people to forgive the United States for doing that.As a matter of fact,some of the comments that the children made subsequent.to the presentation were that they could not believe that their country,in other words,the United States,could have ever done such a thing.

**spk_1:** [36:21.31 - 37:38.16] Well,this is an example of giving children just some information without the whole picture,and if they had known what went before,as those of us who lived through that do,they would come to an entirely different conclusion.But I appreciate your telling us this story.It,it confirms the notion that these courses in school.Are designed to instill guilt,uh,fear,uh,despair,and even promote suicidal tendencies which you mentioned.Uh,some of the comments that have made in other parts of the country after students have been put through these courses are things like,It's hard for me seriously to think about the future when there's this terrifying reality that there may not be any future,and,uh,the students who write that fear and helplessness overwhelm them.Now you'll be interested to know that Doctor Shands,who's with us today,has recently been to a conference of the kind of people who are promoting these courses,and they are realizing that that type of a presentation is counterproductive,and they are instead promoting the idea that uh we should all love the show.People because they are just like us and you want to comment on that?No,

**spk_3:** [37:38.42 - 37:46.88] I just agree with you that that's what their purpose is right now so that we'll be peaceful and we won't see that there's any need to defend ourselves and

**spk_1:** [37:46.88 - 38:24.26] they want to sell the idea that nuclear weapons are bad per se.They're bad in themselves.And of course they are the great backbone of our defense.Winston Churchill once said there wouldn't have been a free man left in Western Europe if it had not been for the American nuclear umbrella,and that is for the demonstration of the power that we had at the end of World War II,a power that was greater than all the other countries in the world combined.Uh well,thanks for sharing that with us,Susan.We appreciate your being with us,and we'll go to our next set of announcements,Bruce.

**spk_0:** [38:24.42 - 38:34.58] We certainly will.Phyllis,just about 30 seconds here.If you don't mind,how are these courses justified on nuclear war by,let's say,the National Education Association?

**spk_1:** [38:34.68 - 38:56.46] I would say they are justified simply on the arrogant attitude that the schools can do anything they want to with the schoolchildren.They treat them in many cases just like guinea pigs.They think the parents are interfering censors and right-wing fundamentalists if they have any objection.And it's just a we're going to do whatever we want attitude.

**spk_0:** [38:56.72 - 39:09.09] Let's talk more about nuclear war courses taught in public schools.If you're just joining us on the USA Radio Network,make it a point to be here every week for Philly Schlafly Live.We'll return.

**spk_7:** [39:20.00 - 40:18.70] A national panel reported that 25% of 17-year-olds are functional illiterates.Another 40% are marginal illiterates.That means nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science.What have they been doing all those years in public schools?Sex education,death education,new age meditation,and other non-academic psychological activities.This can be stopped.US law gives you,the parents,primary control over your children's education.Find out about your rights.Read the Education Reporter.It's a monthly newspaper from Eagle-Forum.The education reporter keeps you informed about offensive school curricula and about victories won by parents who assert their rights.Write for a free sample of the education reporter.The address Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_0:** [41:18.49 - 41:24.49] And this week on Phyllis-Schlafly Live,it's nuclear war courses taught in the public schools.

**spk_1:** [41:24.62 - 42:13.53] The chief special interest group that's been promoting nuclear war courses in the school is an outfit called Educators for Social Responsibility headquartered in Cambridge,Massachusetts.They brag that they've almost single-handedly brought this discussion into the public and have helped to lobby the institution of such.Courses in the schools a couple of years ago they went into a place called Napa Valley,California and tried to make an example of mandating a course in nuclear war in the school system there and that's when I met a man named Baltimar Sanchez who's on the line with us now from Napa,California,and I want to ask you,Baltimar,to tell us what happened when you heard.The schools in your area were going to be putting in a course on nuclear war.

**spk_8:** [42:13.88 - 43:12.07] Well,I'd be happy to,Phyllis.I had had some friends who had attended school board meetings on a regular basis,and from that we had understood that the educators for social responsibility were framing some coursework to be developed into Napa County,and basically how this worked originally is that the A bill called AB 3848 was introduced by a San Jose Democrat,uh,assemblyman John Vasconcelos,in which,um,uh,in conjunction with efforts by educators for social responsibility,uh,the bill was an advisory bill to the California Board of Education to allow the development of a curricula on nuclear issues in the classroom.The Napa Unified School District Board of Education jumped the gun and that.to implement to develop a program to implement that in not just the curricula of the school system,but from

**spk_1:** [43:15.95 - 43:20.14] the 12th grade 12th grade they were going to teach nuclear war.So what happened?

**spk_8:** [43:21.00 - 43:21.36] I'm sorry,

**spk_1:** [43:21.51 - 43:22.04] what did you do

**spk_8:** [43:22.04 - 43:22.42] next?

**spk_1:** [43:22.68 - 43:22.92] Well,

**spk_8:** [43:23.02 - 43:43.02] uh,we decided that we didn't want to have that in our classroom,and I'll tell you that the,the key thing that that touched this off is that we knew that the majority of the school board was in full sympathy with and in cooperation with nuclear freeze and anti-nuclear oriented groups.And so we knew that the curriculum would allow the introduction of politically biased topics within the classroom.

**spk_1:** [43:43.49 - 43:45.48] And that of course was the purpose of it.

**spk_8:** [43:45.58 - 44:32.32] Oh,absolutely,absolutely.We weren't,you know,we didn't want politics in the classroom.We didn't want the issues of nuclear energy and nuclear weaponry to be to be combined as they would have been.We didn't want selective views of history being taught in classrooms,for example,with the issue at Hiroshima and how that's viewed as how it was to have been put forth as killing 800.people versus saving several million lives of Japanese and Americans and we didn't want that to happen.So we,we put together a program to fight this.We didn't,didn't want our children to have to to have this in the classroom.So we identified several candidates to run against these individuals who were on the school board who were up for election in that year.

**spk_1:** [44:32.82 - 44:35.70] You just happened to be up for a school board election at that time,

**spk_8:** [44:35.78 - 44:51.17] right?Exactly.Now we,uh,uh,found several individuals who we thought would make attractive alternatives that were open-minded,that supported traditional values in the classroom.They didn't seek to have politics brought into the classroom and

**spk_1:** [44:51.17 - 44:52.93] they made that an issue in their campaign.

**spk_8:** [44:53.05 - 44:54.85] Oh,absolutely.Now we're

**spk_1:** [44:54.85 - 44:54.91] going

**spk_8:** [44:54.91 - 44:55.01] to

**spk_1:** [44:55.01 - 44:59.87] run out of time pretty soon,Baltimore,so let's move into the exciting part.

**spk_8:** [45:00.09 - 45:47.73] OK.Well,we decided that we walked precincts for them and that we campaigned with them and held various high profile events and sent a message to the school board that this was not going to be tolerated.Um,as a result of that,uh,they knew that there were many,uh,people and voters out in the Napa community who did not want to have this type of,of,uh,uh curriculum brought into the school system,and the result of that is that Uh,it was pulled back.Uh,it was shelved indefinitely,and the curriculum and the,the,uh,whole process was,was eliminated,and we're,we continue to be vigilant to make sure that this type of program is not reintroduced into the school system and,and,uh,based on efforts that you've,you've helped with,uh,in that,uh,in that program there by coming out and,and talking with us and,and being part of a high profile event that we essentially stopped it from taking place in Napa.

**spk_1:** [45:48.12 - 45:55.65] Well,that was a big civic event.There must have been hundreds of people there and more press than have ever come out for any event in Napa.Well,

**spk_8:** [45:55.89 - 46:21.50] it was,it was very interesting because not only did we get local press on this,but we got some Bay Area press,and you know that means 3 to 4 million people knew what we had done in Napa,and it was basically the work of a small group of dedicated individuals that happened to hear what was going on in Napa.But once this issue was brought before the general public,we were really not surprised at the number of people who did not want this to take place in their classrooms.

**spk_1:** [46:21.92 - 47:08.69] Well,it took some kind of leadership.I think your story is very exciting because it shows how a citizen protest can be very effective and can be successful,and the special interest group that was promoting this type of biased disarmament,pacifist promoting nuclear war course then went under a rock,and they haven't been heard from since in Napa Valley.Is that right?That's correct.Well,congratulations on a great victory.We,we appreciate that example of what parents can do.Thank you for joining us today.Uh,Doctor Shands,do you have any further suggestions about what parents can do when they,uh,encounter a nuclear war course or something of that sort in the curriculum of their children?

**spk_3:** [47:09.64 - 47:47.32] Well,I think that they ought to draw on,uh,the teacher's natural instincts.Uh,teachers really want to have kids use the newspapers because it makes,uh,learning very exciting and up to date.I,I would hate to see something like the new START treaty that's being negotiated swe.Under the table because there are some real dangers,uh,by accepting a treaty with the Soviets,uh,the treaty that's been proposed.So I would say to get your teachers,uh,to use newspapers to get them to have debates among their students,debate the START treaty.Um,the big issue is where to get the information on the other side.Well,

**spk_1:** [47:47.40 - 48:13.59] I would say,uh,Dr.Shands,that you believe in making sure that the school gives a balanced treatment with pro and con if they deal with these subjects,uh,but where they're coming in with a prepackaged,uh,brainwashing effort to sell a particular idea as they were.In Napa,California,and other places,then the parents ought to rise up and stop it because that is not what we send our children to school for.

**spk_0:** [48:13.75 - 48:26.86] Phyllis,you've got some comments,I'm sure to tie this whole program together on nuclear war being taught in the public schools.So on the USA Radio Network,stay with us.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_9:** [48:38.84 - 49:35.47] Too many children have been cheated out of the education they deserve.Did you know that nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science?That's a problem we can no longer afford to ignore.Educational excellence in the public school starts with respect for the rights of students,parents,and taxpayers.But what are they?Every student has the right to be taught to read the English language in the first grade.Every student has the right to family privacy,the right to his religious faith and beliefs,the right to share information with his parents.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy from Eagle-Forum.Learn more about the rights you and your children should expect.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy by writing Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_7:** [49:35.93 - 50:32.14] Informing the public about real issues in education today,that's the job of Radio Live with Phyllis-Schlafly,but we need your help.Encourage your friends to listen to the program and thank this station for carrying it.Get your friends a cassette copy of this program.Give a subscription of the education reporter to your church or child's teacher,and don't forget about our packets that accompany information discussed on the program each week.Packets are available for $10 each on topics such as AIDS education,sex education,new age education,drug education,Quest,the NEA,and more.Send $5 for cassettes and $10 for packets to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Remember to specify the date of the program and topic when you order.That's $5 for cassettes and $10 for packets to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.

**spk_1:** [50:33.19 - 51:11.95] Most of the nuclear war courses that have been brought into the public schools are designed to make us feel guilty for winning World War II,are designed to make the children believe that weapons are bad instead of necessary for our national defense.They are also designed to make us.Believe that the Russians are really good guys just like us,and we can get along without weapons or national defense.Parents should be on guard to make sure that any such courses give a balanced treatment about the issues that are so vital for our future security.Join me again next week when we will have another exciting discussion about what goes on in the public school classroom.
