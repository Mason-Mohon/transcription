**spk_0:** [00:00.66 - 00:09.74] Every time we discuss problems in education,the educators all say we need more money through raising taxes.Do you think more money is the cure?

**spk_1:** [00:11.07 - 00:45.56] Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Bruce Hayes here inviting your telephone calls at 1-800-736-3202.Now,in the elections this November,several propositions were on the ballot in different states to raise taxes,to provide more funds for education.These proposals for tax increases were all heavily backed by the education establishment in those.States,but most of these proposals for new taxes lost.Today we'll talk with some of the people who were involved in those campaigns and find out why.

**spk_0:** [00:45.76 - 01:09.33] Our first guest today is Kathy Michols in the state of Washington.She led a grassroots citizens movement that in a referendum earlier this month on November 7th decisively defeated what was called the Children's Initiative.This proposal was a good example of how a tax increase was supported by everybody who was anybody important in the state,but when the votes were counted,the people defeated it.

**spk_1:** [01:09.66 - 01:29.31] Well,we're also going to be going to your telephone calls today,so be sure to jot down our toll-free number anywhere in America.1-800-736-3.202.That's 1-800-736-3202.Now on the line with us from Lynden,Washington,Kathy Michols.Hello,

**spk_0:** [01:29.39 - 01:30.16] Kathy.Yes,

**spk_2:** [01:30.29 - 01:31.33] good morning,Phyllis.Well,

**spk_0:** [01:31.38 - 01:39.25] we're very happy to have you join us.First of all,tell us what was this thing called the Children's Initiative that you had on the ballot on November 7th?

**spk_2:** [01:39.53 - 01:55.99] Well,first of all,it was obviously cleverly named and marketed,having a title,the Children's Initiative.What it would require was $360 million to be raised by either new or increased taxes each year for children's programs and education in Washington State.

**spk_0:** [01:56.32 - 01:59.36] Would that include,for example,early childhood education?

**spk_2:** [01:59.56 - 02:15.22] Yes,that included a whole range of Of,you know,different programs,early childhood education,child care,reducing classroom sizes,and then they had a catch-all that was basically and for any other program that they saw fit.

**spk_0:** [02:15.61 - 02:19.22] Well,tell us,who were some of the important people who supported this.Well,

**spk_2:** [02:19.30 - 02:39.13] one of the obviously biggest supporters was the teachers union,and they contributed to the campaign approximately 10.$30,000.The state employees union,the PTA,the medical community,the Washington State Council of Police Officers,the Association of Child Abuse Counsels,and the governor was one of the big supporters of it.

**spk_0:** [02:39.37 - 02:43.89] Did they spend,did they spend money on media,on television?Oh yes,

**spk_2:** [02:43.97 - 02:48.71] they spent,uh,they raised approximately at the end of the campaign $500,000.

**spk_0:** [02:49.25 - 02:52.69] And did that was this all reported as a political expense?

**spk_2:** [02:53.73 - 02:55.53] Yes,this was absolutely.

**spk_0:** [02:55.65 - 02:57.97] And what kind of television ads did they run?

**spk_2:** [02:58.29 - 03:20.76] Well,they ran very emotional television ads.The whole thing was that's why people didn't want to oppose it.They showed ads of children who were abused.They played on the emotions continuously of people,and that was the frustrating part because nobody wanted to be involved because everyone knew it would pass,and then they would be labeled or branded as being against kids.

**spk_0:** [03:21.00 - 03:30.30] Well,as you looked at the media.A campaign you led a grassroots movement against the so-called Children's initiative.Did you have TV ads

**spk_2:** [03:30.49 - 03:58.73] at the very end?We did two weeks before the end of the campaign.Boeing Company and Warehouser,some of the bigger ones.They put $50,000 into the campaign.And there was some media coverage that we did receive,but it was truly a grassroots campaign.We had worked for over a year.We had county coordinators in every county of the state.It was really a wonderful example of how you can make a difference with little to no money.

**spk_0:** [03:58.93 - 04:01.89] Did you pass out flyers?Was that one of your principal techniques?Yes,

**spk_2:** [04:02.01 - 04:21.01] we passed out flyers.and we had people who were debating this issue across the state who had never debated at all.And you know,it was a hard issue to debate because anybody can stand up there and talk about the needs.And so we had just your regular citizens who were jumping out into the process and were debating and getting on radio programs.

**spk_0:** [04:21.20 - 04:25.64] Did you have any important politicians who were opposed to the children's initiative?Well,

**spk_2:** [04:25.72 - 04:30.72] We had a few that had guts to stand up against it,but like I said,

**spk_0:** [04:30.80 - 04:40.70] well,I,for example,did you have any,any state officers who opposed it?Did you have any,any congressmen,senators,or state legislators who opposed it?Well,

**spk_2:** [04:40.76 - 04:57.74] we had state legislators,yes,but I'll tell you they were few and far between because like I stated,they were all scared to jump in and oppose it.Because they didn't want to run the chance.See,we were supposed to have lost,and all the polls indicated,you know,8 months before the vote was taken that we were losing.

**spk_0:** [04:58.09 - 05:00.13] So what did the polls show just before the election?

**spk_2:** [05:00.45 - 05:04.90] Before the elections,it was about a 50/50.They knew it was going to be very close.

**spk_0:** [05:04.97 - 05:06.97] And what did the vote show?The vote showed

**spk_2:** [05:06.97 - 05:14.43] that it failed 70% to 30% mark.and it failed in every county in the state.It was a landslide victory for the voters of the state.

**spk_0:** [05:14.51 - 05:18.01] That's more than 2 to 1.Was everybody shocked?Oh,

**spk_2:** [05:18.19 - 05:34.72] they were,yes,they were definitely shocked,and I think I was probably one of the most shocked myself,but it was an issue where we,we kept on and on.It was like beating your head against the wall.We thought nothing was.Coming together and when you're working in a grassroots campaign you can't see all the little things that are going on.

**spk_0:** [05:34.92 - 05:39.24] Well,you don't think the vote shows that the people of the state of Washington are against children,do you?No,

**spk_2:** [05:39.40 - 06:19.19] absolutely not.You know,at the end of the campaign,the reporters were saying,well,well now what are we going to do for children?You know,we don't have this money.I said,listen,we clearly have money for children.You know,we have been spending more money on education than any nation in the world.We care about children in this nation.And I think what the vote really showed was that the people know that we do care,and this was a frustration on the voters' part.It was a vote of no confidence.We have given you money.Now is the time to sit back and say we want accountability.We demand accountability because we want more money for children,not more money for bureaucrats.

**spk_0:** [06:19.30 - 06:35.08] Well,one more question before we sign off,Kathy,and that is,do you think the vote shows that that the people were simply against any tax?Increase or do you think it shows that they didn't like the way the tax increase was going to spend and the additional power that it would give to the state over children?

**spk_2:** [06:35.43 - 06:55.04] I think that it was,was,was both very strongly both.However,I think that the people towards the end of the campaign saw that this was simply a liberal spending scheme that was wrapped in pro-child rhetoric,and they were upset.And when they saw that at the end of the campaign,they were,they were angry because they felt they had been used.

**spk_0:** [06:55.32 - 07:02.75] Well,congratulations,Kathy,on your big victory in defeating this tax increase for a so-called children's initiative.We wish you well.Thank you.

**spk_1:** [07:03.32 - 07:29.58] And there's a story from Washington,of course,but how about this whole tax issue in states like New Jersey,Missouri,California?Come on in.Let's hear from you at 1-800-736-3202,especially if you've had some insight into the matter or maybe you just have a question for Phyllis again.1-800-736-3.202.Already people starting to line up here.Here's Betty in Michigan for Philly Schlafly.Hello Betty.

**spk_0:** [07:30.56 - 07:35.07] Michigan had a tax increase for education on the ballot in November,didn't it?

**spk_3:** [07:35.23 - 07:38.20] We had two proposals on the ballot for a tax increase.

**spk_0:** [07:38.64 - 07:42.09] First of all,tell us how much of a tax increase did it amount to?Well,

**spk_3:** [07:42.20 - 08:26.98] proposal A was a 0.5 cent sales tax increase,which was actually 12.5% increase from 4.0 to 4.5%. It was in reality a $4 million tax.Increase.It did not provide any property tax relief,and it did not address how the money would be distributed for education,although the big TV ads said it would be for computers and math and all this,which was really an out and out lie.The legislature and the governor would determine how that money was to be spent.Now Proposal B was a 2 cents sales tax increase,which was actually a 50% increase.We moved from 4 cents to 6 cents sales tax.It was a temporary property tax relief,possibly just a year property tax relief.

**spk_0:** [08:27.17 - 08:31.38] Now,you think maybe the voters didn't believe that they were really going to get any property tax relief?

**spk_3:** [08:31.53 - 08:44.99] Well,there's no doubt when they looked at the statistics because really you could check through the Department of Treasury from 76 to 86.The average millage rate was 3.3%,but the state property evaluation rose 95%.

**spk_0:** [08:45.17 - 08:50.83] Well,now tell us all the good things that the state of Michigan said they were going to do with all this extra money.

**spk_3:** [08:51.13 - 09:06.01] Well,they were just going to improve education.They were going to have more programs in math and science and the computers in every classroom.I mean,the stories they told was unreal as how they presented it to the taxpayers of Michigan.Well,

**spk_0:** [09:06.09 - 09:11.25] are you telling us that they were principally selling this tax increase for math and computers?

**spk_3:** [09:11.54 - 09:24.01] Yes,and in fact there was even a court case on it.They,they had at one time there's an injunction to keep the TV ads off.Because they were illegal,they weren't telling the truth.They were a misrepresentation of the public.

**spk_0:** [09:24.18 - 09:29.02] Well,what is your idea of what these two propositions,A and B,were really going to do in Michigan?Well,

**spk_3:** [09:29.06 - 09:42.90] the hidden agenda was in the Department of Ed budget,which said if either of these got 50% of the votes,it would then mandate state accreditation of every elementary,junior high,middle,and high school in the state of Michigan.

**spk_0:** [09:43.18 - 09:46.33] Well,when you say every,do you mean both public and private?

**spk_3:** [09:46.62 - 10:11.25] Well,no,we don't have the private.Yet,but P Phyllis,it stands to reason.In 1969,the governor at that time said that the way he proposed closing all parochial schools,and it was through a teacher certification and standards,and remember,the standards are the accreditation standards.So I feel that this eventually would have closed all schools and all schools would have been over and.

**spk_0:** [10:11.37 - 10:21.31] You mean closed all schools that were not accredited,right,right,and the and the accredited was tied into teacher certification.And controlled by the Michigan State Department of Education.

**spk_3:** [10:21.50 - 10:36.32] In other words,it read in the,in the state budget that a school district that did not meet state accreditation standards by 9293 school year would lose all funding.In other words,they would bankrupt the school and the state would take over and manage the schools.

**spk_0:** [10:36.87 - 10:51.02] Do you think that the voters suspected this hidden agenda,or do you think they were really just voting against a tax increase,or do you think maybe they just felt uh we don't want to give those people any more money because they haven't been turning out a good product?

**spk_3:** [10:51.43 - 11:04.30] Well,I think it was all of,all of the above,but I do feel as the people became informed on the issues,definitely,and I,it was defeated with a resounding defeat,I mean 3 to 1.I mean,

**spk_0:** [11:04.58 - 11:06.33] now tell us what the vote was on A and B.

**spk_3:** [11:06.67 - 11:09.09] On A,it was 2.5 against,

**spk_0:** [11:09.59 - 11:12.39] that is,it was defeated 2.5 to 1,right?

**spk_3:** [11:12.55 - 11:15.86] And proposal B was 3 to 1.So,well,

**spk_0:** [11:15.90 - 11:19.73] that was a smashing defeat.What,what did the polls show prior to the election?

**spk_3:** [11:20.06 - 11:31.70] Well,according to what we were hearing on TV,they felt that Proposal A,because it had the support of the MEA,the governor,GM,Ford,Chrysler,the retail association,all of these were behind Proposal A.

**spk_0:** [11:31.77 - 11:32.01] In other

**spk_3:** [11:32.01 - 11:32.14] words,

**spk_0:** [11:32.18 - 11:35.42] the businesses were behind it as well as the politicians.Big business,

**spk_3:** [11:35.54 - 11:43.71] yes,but the chamber.Commerce were behind both were against both proposals,and they were a great,great asset in defeating it.

**spk_0:** [11:43.91 - 11:50.98] Well,did you defeat it by grassroots action,passing out flyers,going on radio interviews and that type of thing?

**spk_3:** [11:51.14 - 12:41.49] Definitely.This is how I feel it was defeated because even school board members and teachers didn't realize that this would give the state total control of the.Schools and uh one little pamphlet was copied and and sent throughout the the state of Michigan and I know personally I did a lot of talk shows others did regarding the issue and I at the CWA,uh,big convention here I know at each one in the state throughout the state the same pamphlets were passed out which was just before the November 7th vote so As the public,of course,the news media never covered the issue of state takeover of the schools.It was only by people writing letters to the editor,getting on talk shows,and passing,passing out the pamphlet was the public finally aware of what the issue was.The issue was state takeover the schools through the passage of either one of these proposals.

**spk_0:** [12:41.56 - 12:44.76] How much do you think the Michigan Education Association spent on this?

**spk_3:** [12:44.89 - 12:47.39] It's my understanding they spent 2.5 million.

**spk_0:** [12:47.57 - 12:49.53] And how much do you think the opponents spent?

**spk_3:** [12:50.10 - 13:13.36] Uh,I don't think there was that much spent.I do know the Chamber of Commerce did spend some money,but the grassroots certainly didn't.Our main thrust was copying this little informative sheet and get the information out to the public,so they were fully aware.What the repercussions of the passage of either one of these 50%.Our,our issue was to get the vote out.If we didn't get the vote out,then either one of these could have passed.

**spk_0:** [13:13.65 - 13:22.09] Well,were there any really important people who opposed these propositions A and B,or was it strictly a kind of a nobody grassroots action?

**spk_3:** [13:22.37 - 13:46.84] No,Headley opposed them,and the Hedley Amendment.Extremely important here in Michigan because anything that the state mandates,the state must support and according to even the,the,uh,property tax relief,if a proposal B would have passed,it would allow assessment levels to rise without voter control,which would eliminate the Headley amendment.So Hedley himself really did campaign against it too,which was a blessing.

**spk_0:** [13:47.50 - 14:07.91] Well,congratulations on your big defeat,uh,of the,uh,propositions A and B,which would have constituted a state takeover of,uh,the control of education in Michigan.Uh,it really was a surprising,uh,2 to 1 and 2.5 to 1 defeat of those resolutions.Uh,so we thank you for sharing this with us today,Betty,

**spk_0:** [17:02.95 - 17:13.84] Hello John.We've been talking about,uh,the defeat of,uh,tax increases which are supposedly for the purpose of,of giving money to education.What do you know about that?

**spk_6:** [17:14.74 - 17:20.58] Well,I know,uh,we just had the defeat of proposal A,and,uh,

**spk_0:** [17:20.78 - 17:25.00] did you work on that?Yes,I did a little bit.Well,tell us what you did.Well,I found out

**spk_6:** [17:25.00 - 17:34.46] enough,you know,enough where I felt like I had to do something,and,uh.What I had done,I took a message up to the state capitol.I rented an ape outfit.

**spk_0:** [17:34.92 - 17:36.64] Did you say an ape outfit,an outfit,

**spk_6:** [17:37.68 - 17:38.00] ape as

**spk_0:** [17:38.00 - 17:38.63] in a monkey,

**spk_6:** [17:38.82 - 18:02.47] as in a monkey,and I guess,uh.I guess basically the message was you don't have to be a monkey brain.I guess any educated person could see that,uh,proposals A and B were both,uh,Bad apples.So,uh,I had taken 8 cases of extra fancy Washington apples up to the,uh,state Capitol.And was passing them out with literature that I had

**spk_0:** [18:02.77 - 18:20.36] literature on propositions A and B and why people should vote against it.Well,I think that's a neat idea.I can remember years ago when I was fighting the Equal Rights Amendment battle.I got a friend who dressed up in a monkey suit,and we had a lot of bananas and passed them out at the state Capitol,and our theme was don't monkey around with the Constitution.

**spk_6:** [18:20.57 - 18:20.83] Yeah.

**spk_0:** [18:21.33 - 18:23.63] So go ahead.So you passed out the flyers and uh.

**spk_6:** [18:23.85 - 18:56.12] Yeah,the information that I was putting out was,uh.You know,said Michigan needs new priorities,not new taxes.And,uh,although proposal A would,would have generated more money for the schools,how the money would have been spent was yet to be determined by future legislation.In other words,there was no real guarantee about any benefits of how each school district would receive the money.And it was presented to the people as a 0.5 cent sales tax,you know,sales tax increase,but actually what it was,was a $400 million tax increase.

**spk_0:** [18:57.19 - 19:03.00] Well,the voters must have agreed with you.Have you done anything in political activism before,or was this new to you?No,

**spk_6:** [19:03.11 - 19:12.87] that was,uh,that was pretty new.That was,uh,that was one of my first.But,uh,you know,I got a real favorable response up at the Capitol and Uh,

**spk_0:** [19:14.17 - 19:26.25] Well,that's great.I,I hope,uh,I hope you've gotten the,the message and,and you have seen how an individual can take action and be successful.So join up with Eagle-Forum and we'll do all kinds of exciting things.

**spk_1:** [19:26.34 - 19:36.32] Yeah,but you never know.I hope he holds on to the ape suit.We move on to Belleville.A little humor,Phyllis.We move on to Belleville,Illinois over Station KSIV,and here's Kathy.

**spk_0:** [19:36.44 - 19:41.84] Hello Kathy.Uh,do you have some experience on the matter of tax increases?

**spk_7:** [19:42.06 - 20:20.00] Well,yes,recently,uh,it was put before the voters to pass a bond increase to expand the classrooms in our district,and the children at my daughter's school were sent home a paper,and on it.The parents were asked.Ah,if each was a registered voter,how each was going to vote on this proposition,and if you were not registered,uh,what time would be a good time to have someone come to your home to register you to vote?

**spk_0:** [20:20.50 - 20:28.56] Now let me understand this.This is the teachers using their pupils in the classroom to find out how the parents are going to vote.

**spk_7:** [20:29.87 - 20:32.47] I assume it was signed by the PTA president,

**spk_0:** [20:32.55 - 20:34.72] but the teachers handed it out in the classroom,right?

**spk_7:** [20:34.83 - 20:36.73] It was sent home to every student.

**spk_0:** [20:37.35 - 20:38.97] Well,I think that's rather shocking.

**spk_7:** [20:39.13 - 20:44.72] Well,many parents objected to being asked how they were going to vote.

**spk_0:** [20:45.47 - 20:47.67] I thought we had a secret ballot in this country.Well,

**spk_7:** [20:47.74 - 21:27.86] that's what we thought,and the parents were outraged that they had to write on a paper.Their,their,uh,thoughts or how they felt about this,as you said,we thought we lived in a society where our forefathers fought for the right to give us a secret ballot.Many husbands and wives don't even tell their spouses how they vote.They feel it's that private a matter.And for the school district to ask you,they didn't ask if we were in favor of it.They didn't ask if you thought it was a good idea.They specifically asked how we were going to vote.And that's what the parents found extremely objectionable.

**spk_0:** [21:28.06 - 21:32.42] Do you know if many parents lodged their objection with the school or the teachers?

**spk_7:** [21:32.75 - 21:41.31] There were some,many parents either just filled out their child's name and didn't answer any questions or just didn't turn them in.

**spk_0:** [21:41.59 - 21:51.67] Well,now,was this questionnaire that the child brought home,uh,did it have a literature about the bond issue too that the child was given?Yes,

**spk_7:** [21:51.75 - 21:57.54] in an open house we were given.Uh,facts concerning the proposition and why they wanted to do it.

**spk_0:** [21:57.81 - 22:06.83] And was the child told that that he really ought to do this or he would be reprimanded or rewarded depending on whether he brought it back?

**spk_7:** [22:07.01 - 22:21.71] Well,several were,were told that they would lose some kind of privilege,be it a recess or Merit points or something like this,they were not carried out.If they returned them or if they didn't,no punishment was given,

**spk_0:** [22:21.95 - 22:23.95] but the child was made to believe that there would be,

**spk_7:** [22:24.03 - 22:46.88] right,as I assume,a form of encouragement so that they could have some sort of parole.On,on the feelings in the district.We were also,uh,there were apparent volunteers out of the classrooms who called.Uh,the homes of all the students to inquire as how the parents were going to vote on this issue.

**spk_0:** [22:47.14 - 23:15.28] Well,I'm glad you called,uh,Kathy,because a lot of people don't realize how the teachers union,works in politics,and they have a very effective political organization through the National Education Association and its state affiliates.Uh,they work to get people to the polls and as.You have told us they use the children in the classroom to get votes for anything that they think is the way you ought to vote.So we appreciate your call,Kathy.All right,thank you.

**spk_1:** [23:15.56 - 23:26.15] The forum is yours at 1-800-736-3202.Let's hear from you.We move on to Indianapolis over WXIR.Who's Suzanne.

**spk_0:** [23:26.40 - 23:30.17] Hello,Suzanne.Uh,what's your question or comment?Well,

**spk_3:** [23:30.26 - 24:48.90] we're having a referendum here in Indianapolis,Indiana.In Washington Township.Could you talk up a little louder?OK.We're having a referendum in Indianapolis in Washington Township on December 5th,and our,um,school district wants the monies from the property tax increase to support pay raises for the teachers and a number of questionable and experimental educational programs.And one of these programs which the district wants to implement with tax monies is a program called Parents as First Teachers.Um,this program Parents with First Teachers was first introduced,um,in the legislature or the this past legislature in 1988-18989,and it failed.Now our school district,um,wants to put into operation the same,um,program,and they have started a pilot program uh at John Strange Elementary School,um,and it's still the same program,it's Parents as First Teachers,and it was a it's available to all the children and presently,um,it's Uh,voluntary,and then they have funding.They get their funding from the Department of Education.Um,this is a word for word program according to the Missouri or Zig Ziggler plan and it works like,um,well,I'll tell you,it works as follows,um,a licensed child care specialist conducts group training sessions with first-time parents which,according,um,

**spk_0:** [24:50.43 - 25:41.57] Well,let,let me explain to our listeners in case they don't know what the Ziegler plan is,uh,Ziegler is the leading guru of,uh,a group of child developmentalists who think that the bureaucracy ought to take over the raising of children from infancy,uh,using the public schools as a headquarters,and,uh,they want to supervise,monitor,and direct the care of infants.Even if they're in the home or in neighborhood care centers and then ultimately get them in the public schools by the age of 3,and they think that they know a great deal more about the raising of children than parents do,mere parents,what in the world would they know?Uh,these people with their,uh,advanced degrees,I think they should direct this.That's the Ziegler plan and that's why they're so eager to get more money into it.So I just,you mentioned Ziggler,and I.that for our listeners,but go ahead and tell us.

**spk_3:** [25:42.55 - 25:52.52] They start with a 3rd trimester of pregnancy or or at birth just like you said,um,and by age 3 they,they predict that they can,um,they can predict the competence of a child.

**spk_0:** [25:52.77 - 25:54.70] Oh,they start testing them at age 3,yeah,

**spk_3:** [25:54.77 - 26:08.76] they do developmental testing all along the way from what I understand.And then at 3 they think they,you know,they will be able to predict,um,the competence of that child,and then,um.They can direct it.To the proper channels.Well,

**spk_0:** [26:08.84 - 26:34.84] it certainly is true that in the 1st 3 years of life,the child learns more probably than he does in any other 3 years,uh,but it is not true that they can test and predict the child,nor is there any evidence that if we turn the raising of children over to the so-called experts that would be better than it were in the hands of teachers.So,so they want to give you a property tax increase in order to implement the Ziegler plan in your county.Is that it?Yes,

**spk_3:** [26:34.96 - 26:56.32] that's correct.And when I talked to the superintendent,I asked him whose philosophy of child development the government was adopting,and he told me it was no one's philosophy,and I said,but it has to be someone's,and he said no,it was no one's.It was,he said it,you know,it was like toilet training.And then I told him I said,Well,there's countless theories on,um,potty training or toilet training and then that's where our conversation ended,um.

**spk_0:** [26:57.54 - 27:02.81] Well,the proposition that will be on your ballot,it'll be to vote yes or no on a property tax increase for,

**spk_3:** [27:03.54 - 27:28.31] um,for,um,pay increases for the teacher,a quality reading teacher for each elementary,counseling for the elementary school children,uh,full-time emergency medical personnel,and then the parents of first teacher programs,and then there's another one,mandatory,um,alternative school program for delinquent and high-risk,um,students,and they haven't even.On that one,told parents or taxpayers what exactly they're going to implement.

**spk_0:** [27:28.70 - 27:47.98] Uh,well,it seems to me you have a lot of issues there.One issue is whether you want to load this extra cost onto the backs of the hard pressed property,uh,owners.Um,another is,do you want all these programs?Uh,I'd be careful of the counselors.Um,stand by,Suzanne.We have to take a break and,uh,we'll finish up with this after our break.And we're

**spk_1:** [27:47.98 - 28:09.41] looking forward to hearing.You at 1-800-736-3202.Again,that's toll-free number 1-800-736-3202.We're talking about whether or not to raise taxes in order to help the public schools.There are many offshoots of this whole issue,and we'll keep talking about it.We will return on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_1:** [29:20.23 - 29:44.46] Welcome back to the USA Radio Network's presentation of Philly Schlafly Live,and we're talking about raising taxes for the public schools.Does it work?What's your experience?We're at 1-800-736-3202.Jot it down 1-800-736-3202.Phyllis,we were talking with Suzanne in Indianapolis,and why don't we recap what we were talking about?

**spk_0:** [29:44.56 - 30:55.06] Yes,are you still there,Suzanne?Well,I wanted to discuss with you a little further what you said that The tax increase was for now you mentioned several things.Uh,one is to have more counselors.Well,I'd be very suspicious of having more counselors.My impression of public schools is that they have too many counselors already and some of the counselors are telling them the wrong things.Then you mentioned,uh,having,uh,more money for,um,some type of medical facility,and you certainly have to look out for that because,uh,what a lot of people want to do is to put these medical clinics in the public.Schools and it suddenly turns out that the big purpose of that is to dispense contraceptives to minors.Yes,that's my suspicion,and I would always be suspicious of that.Now there's fine to have a school nurse to take the child's temperature if he appears to be ill and send him home if he's too sick and that sort of thing,but this idea of,uh,of establishing some type of comprehensive medical care,uh,is socialized medicine out of the schools,pure and simple,plus the distribution of contraceptives.Then you mentioned,uh,raising salaries.Do you have any idea what the teachers' salaries are in your area right now?

**spk_3:** [30:55.24 - 31:32.30] Um,yes,um,I've done a little research on that.According to,um,the August 1988,uh,Indianapolis Star,um,article,they did a,uh,coverage of the Marion County teachers' salaries,and they represented 10 or they had 10 districts represented or reported on that.And Washington Township's average teacher's teacher's salary was the highest at 85 or I'm sorry,at 35,000.Um,based on this article,they were to receive an additional 70% raise from the,uh,98 from the 1988-18989 school year,um,which would bring them to an average now of uh 37,000.Um,

**spk_0:** [31:32.51 - 32:26.40] that's the average,average teacher's salary in your area is 37,000 nationally,the average teacher's salary is about,uh,30,000.So you're considerably above that and we also ought to comment that the teachers work 180 days a year whereas most people work 240 days a year.Correct,yes.Uh,so,and then,and then the other portion of this tax increase is for,um,is for this,uh,parents' first teachers modeled on the Missouri Ziegler plan and,uh,that is a is a grab for power by the bureaucracy to take over the care and raising of infant children.And to make it centered in the public schools,I,you should be very leery of that.You don't want you,I wouldn't think you would want to do that.So I,I hope you alert the people in your area,uh,to the fact that the schools don't need any more money and if they have it,we don't want them to do some of the things that they say they're going to do.

**spk_3:** [32:26.90 - 32:29.37] Well,I appreciate your,um,feedback and

**spk_0:** [32:29.37 - 32:30.96] um was there anything else you wanted to add?

**spk_3:** [32:31.11 - 32:32.38] I think that's about it.

**spk_0:** [32:33.02 - 32:37.84] Well,we appreciate your call and good luck.You call,call back after it's over and tell us what happened.

**spk_1:** [32:38.22 - 32:46.38] Counseling parents on their rights and education,that's the job of P Phyllis-Schlafly Live.We push onward to St.Louis.Here's Elaine for Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [32:46.58 - 32:49.79] Hello Elaine.Do you have a question or comment?

**spk_7:** [32:49.94 - 33:07.91] Well,yes,I heard you allude to the Missouri Parents as Teachers program,and I thought I'd elaborate a little bit on that if you'd like me to.Um,a couple points.Um,this did not appear as any kind of a tax measure that we could vote on.It was passed legislatively.And well,

**spk_0:** [33:07.94 - 33:13.24] apparently they tried that in Indiana and the legislature wouldn't pass it,so now they're trying to do it by referendum.Well,

**spk_7:** [33:13.34 - 33:44.88] we have,um,a,a good moral governor who I believe has been misled about the effects of this program.He thinks it's going to be very good and very helpful for Missouri's children,and he did take the leadership in pushing this particular program.And as someone pointed out earlier,it's awfully hard to Oppose some of these things,at least from the legislators' viewpoint.They're afraid they'll be perceived as being anti-child.So there were a lot of good people that did support this.Well,

**spk_0:** [33:44.96 - 33:49.05] yes,you don't want to be anti-child.That's probably even worse than being anti-woman.

**spk_7:** [33:49.20 - 34:09.70] Oh heavens,yes.It's been in effect about 4 years,so,um,even the,the architect of the program,Burton White,was quoted as saying he was a little upset because they didn't wait to get results from the program before they initiated it statewide.But nevertheless,he still supports the concept,of course.Well,

**spk_0:** [34:09.78 - 34:26.94] that's very clever of them to use Dr.Burton White.He is a,he is not an advocate of public daycare.He is very much an advocate of mothers taking care of their own babies.Uh,however,the Ziggler plan is clearly to have the state bureaucracy dictate how the children are raised.

**spk_7:** [34:27.26 - 35:33.85] Yes,and,and the interesting thing on this program is that one component of it is,uh,preschool screening.The idea is that the,um,the professionals go into the home and help the parents,uh,with these small babies,uh,advising them,but,um,this sounds rather good on the surface.However,in their training sessions,we have been told by people who have attended their training sessions that they are to look for signs of child abuse,that spanking should be considered a form of abuse,and that when they go into a home they should look into the refrigerators if they get an opportunity and look for all these little signs that maybe there's some kind of neglect and,um,that's kind of frightening.Of course this program's supposed,it is voluntary right now,but one always wonders how long things are voluntary and then.They're mandated.Another thing,there was an article in the paper that said,uh,that one of the spokesmen or the advocates for this program says we have some of our educators follow expectant women around the supermarket so they can ask them whether they know about the program.So there's all kinds of,

**spk_0:** [35:33.89 - 36:00.14] well,it sounds like Big Brother or Big sister is watching you if you're about to have a baby now.Did you notice that,uh,an,an earlier caller who was talking about this,uh,proposal in Indianapolis said she asked the educators,uh,what,uh,theory of.Child rearing they were going to use and,and he didn't indicate that he knew or that there needed to be a theory,but you mentioned what they do about spanking.It certainly is a theory about whether a child should be spanked or not.

**spk_7:** [36:00.37 - 36:50.05] Yes,and we even,um,our child abuse laws were revised to say that the spanking was not to be considered child abuse.However,that doesn't change their,their ideas that they transmit in their training sessions.They still say to look for that and to consider that as such.It's,um,it's,uh,I,I would be very interested to see some good hard data on this and,uh,especially on this,uh,screening of these little children because my understanding is once that they are labeled in some way,that this label,just,let's say,maybe,um,slow or slow reflex.or something.I don't really know how they do the labeling,but that follows those children through the system and through the schools,and it's awfully hard to shake a label that you've been given by the professionals.

**spk_0:** [36:50.24 - 37:14.52] I noticed that in,uh,in Georgia this year they instituted some type of testing.Uh,for kindergartners,and this,even this is very controversial about whether you can adequately test children to graduate from kindergarten and go into the first grade,and,uh,if even that is controversial,I would say the screening or the testing of a 3 year old is something that the state should not be doing.

**spk_7:** [37:14.93 - 37:31.21] Oh,it's incredible.That can even be topped by a recent article in the Saint Louis Post-Dispatch that,uh,said they're pushing the idea of infant testing so that that might hold a clue to their abilities later on in life.Infants several months old.

**spk_0:** [37:31.29 - 37:52.27] It's incredible what the,uh,these people want to do.I would really like to know how many of them have children of their own.We,we find in this whole daycare fight.That very frequently you've got a bunch of 23 and 24,25 year olds who have no children who are saying that if grandmothers are going to take care of children,they have to be subjected to training by these young women who don't have any children at all.

**spk_7:** [37:52.38 - 38:14.67] Um,one final thing,Phyllis,on this is,um,that this program is so encompassing that they've prepared a video and this video is being sent out to all the maternity.Departments of all the hospitals in Missouri,the,I guess the larger hospitals,I'm sure not all of them,uh,to acquaint new mothers with the program and encourage them to get involved.

**spk_0:** [38:15.11 - 38:38.43] Well,thank you very much for,uh,telling us all about the Missouri plan,which,uh,some people are trying to use as a model.I know that Ziegler testified in Washington before one of the congressional committees about how great the Missouri plan is,and,uh,we find.That in Indiana,where they were not able to get it through the legislature,they're trying to do it by referendum.So parents be on guard if you want to maintain your parental authority over your own children.

**spk_1:** [38:38.73 - 39:01.47] Elaine,thank you for the telephone call,and we have more calls lined up,Phyllis,on this whole matter of raising taxes for the public schools.We're at 1-800-736-3202 just in case you want to join our conversation.Maybe you have some.Insight to shed to this whole matter.1-800-736-3202.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_1:** [41:02.17 - 41:13.66] And thanks for dialing up Phyllis-Schlafly Live on the USA Radio Network.Let's get right back into the telephone calls on this whole matter of raising taxes in the public schools.We visit with Del in Menlo Park,

**spk_0:** [41:14.01 - 43:11.85] California.Hello,Del.We've been talking about tax increases for children.Do you have any question or comment about that?Uh,well,really,I'm calling with some good news for your pro-family listeners about a measure that was defeated in Fremont,California.That's in the San Francisco Bay Area.Now this happened last spring,but I don't think maybe you've heard about it because the secular media,I'm sure didn't cover it.Our forces won.Uh,what they had was a child care tax measure which would have given employed parents,uh,you know,tax,uh,free childcare.I mean tax supported child care and it was voted down by a 12,000 to 3000 vote and that's that sounds like about 1,yeah,3 to 1,yes,so that apparently they thought it was going to win.The newspapers all over the Bay Area said that it was going to,you know,carry by a large.Margin,which it didn't,and they were stunned over there.Well,didn't the voters understand that what we hear on the media,that the days of Ozzie and Harriet are over and all parents have their children in daycare and the taxpayers ought to pay for it?Yeah,that's right.Well,apparently the people did see through that.I think they did vote on principle because it was only a $12.Increase in their taxes,you know,in the household taxes,and they voted it down on principle.Well,you suppose they thought parents ought to take care of their own children?I think so.I think that's what it's coming down to.I think this is one of the first tests in the nation.Yes,I don't know of any other place in the country where they had a vote directly on setting up taxpayer daycare.Of course,Congress has been wrestling with that issue all year,and we've lucked through another year without their passing it.And uh I hope they'll hear about the Fremont vote and realize people don't.And you know,this is not exactly what you'd call a conservative area.I know that in fact they have a child care administrator already ensconced over there.Oh,their government.And so I know,you know,I have felt vibes that this is not exactly a conservative area.So that's even more interesting.Well,thanks for the good news,Dale.We appreciate your call.

**spk_1:** [43:12.68 - 43:32.78] Taxes to provide more funds for education.That's the question we're probing on Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and every week we dissect one topic specifically on your rights in education.Let's move out to another telephone call on 1-800-736.3202 in Noblesville,Indiana,WXIR.Here's Joan.

**spk_0:** [43:32.91 - 43:36.78] Hello Joan.What is your question or comment about this subject?Uh,

**spk_8:** [43:36.98 - 44:01.03] there's so much to say it's hard to know where to begin.Let me start with,uh,the,uh,basic philosophy that is underlying all this intrusiveness that,uh,is going on and that they want more tax dollars for.It's the belief that parents are not capable of raising their own children and that the experts and the.being the experts in this case,know better than the parents do what to do with the children.

**spk_0:** [44:01.21 - 44:03.65] Indeed,I think you hit the nail on the head with that one.

**spk_8:** [44:03.81 - 44:36.24] And the developmental testing,uh,people ought to be aware that the,uh,parents and teachers program,this Missouri Ziegler plan,that the developmental testing,that the additional guidance counselors,all of these things are being pushed by the national education groups,not only the teachers unions,which are going to benefit financially from this.But also by the school boards association,by the state superintendents association,and this is where we're getting this big push and it's coming everywhere,and the parents don't realize it.Developmental testing is,

**spk_0:** [44:36.33 - 44:42.09] would you explain for our listeners what developmental testing is?We've referred to that a couple of times and for many,

**spk_8:** [44:42.21 - 46:16.35] for many years they did what they call readiness testing,and they sometimes still use that terminology,and it used to be to determine whether the children.Ah,were academically ready to learn to read,etc.etc.It was done usually at the end of kindergarten,but you see,there's a whole new components added to it.They are now looking at their emotional development,their physical development,their social development,and these tests,as many behavioral scientists themselves say this,I mean,they're divided on this,and many of them say that the tests are inappropriate,they are unreliable,but Decisions of the child's future are made on how well they do with these programs,and they are so unreliable because children are so different and they change so fast,and it can be psychologically damaging to the child,uh,as somebody said,it will follow the child.Decisions will be made for the child's future,uh,in the schools and so forth,uh,on,on these tests.And yet these tests by many experts are considered unreliable.Uh,it's very,very dangerous.The same thing with the guidance counselors.The push for guidance counselors is for the elementary schools,uh,to,because again,the parents,uh,uh,they're too busy.They're working,they don't care.Uh,they're pushing all this on the schools.Uh,we hear all of these statements and these guidance counselors are very carefully trained on how to elicit.All kinds of information and emotions and so forth from these little children.It's well,

**spk_0:** [46:16.39 - 46:25.98] in the first place,they're not just imposing this on children whose parents don't care,close quote.They want to impose it on the children of parents who do care.Well,

**spk_8:** [46:26.03 - 46:41.85] that's what they're saying.They use this.It's not that the parents don't care.I,I will never believe that.It's that they use this kind of of.Rhetoric and people believe it.Uh,the interesting thing in this Washington Township referendum that that's in

**spk_0:** [46:41.85 - 46:42.24] Indiana,

**spk_8:** [46:42.46 - 48:02.09] that's in Indiana.That's where I used to live.Uh,that's the area I represented in the Senate,and this is a basically wealthy suburban community.They have,uh,year in and year out raised taxes.Now understand in Indiana.You can raise taxes for educational purposes up to a certain limit without any referendum.This referendum is to raise taxes over and above that limit,and they have been very secretive.Uh,there is an article in the paper talking.About that,even they have carefully,according to one of the school board members,ah,provided information and so the push is to get the people that support the referendum out to vote,and there are only 18% of,uh,the parents of the adults in the community that have kids in the school.And they have been feeding them a good line of this is going to improve the quality of education unquote,and they're hoping that all the rest of them,uh,never hear about this and don't come out to vote.Now you know who's going to go out to vote?The people that are going to benefit,the teachers union people and,and their friends and their families because they are going to benefit.greatly from this kind of thing they certainly

**spk_0:** [48:02.09 - 48:06.86] will,and we're out of time,Joan,but we appreciate your insight into this referendum.

**spk_1:** [48:07.20 - 48:21.93] Your fine station,the USA Radio Network and Eagle-Forum Education are proud to bring you this program on parents' rights and education every week.Interesting wrap up to come.It's next on tax increases in the public schools.This is P Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_4:** [48:22.47 - 49:19.18] Eagle-Forum has been leading the pro-family movement to victory since 1972.Eagle-Forum has achieved an unmatched record of success,stopping the anti-family Equal Rights Amendment,preserving women's exemption from the military draft in combat duty,working for federal and state legislation to eliminate child pornography.That's proof that citizen volunteers can determine government policies in Congress and in state legislatures,but the fight continues.Eagle-Forum is now working for a tax credit for every child,for parents and pupils' rights and education,for economic growth through lower taxes,for a strong national defense.And for private enterprise,join us,the men and women of Eagle-Forum who share conservative pro-family values with a faith in God,in America,and with hope for the future based on freedom and opportunity for all.Wright Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.
