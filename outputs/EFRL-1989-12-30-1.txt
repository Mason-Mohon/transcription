**spk_0:** [00:00.89 - 00:09.35] The most controversial courses in public schools are courses about sex.Do you know why parents are up in arms all over the country?

**spk_1:** [00:10.84 - 01:11.70] Live via satellites across America.Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.This is Bruce Hayes,and we'll be going to your telephone calls just about 10 minutes down the line.Should be an exciting one today,Phyllis,and most informative.Let me pass out the telephone number 1-800-736-3202.Right at the opening,just some rhetorical questions for your thought.Today we're going to talk about sex education in the public schools.Is it good or bad,helpful or harmful,respectful of parental rights or offensive to family values and standards.Are sex courses given only with parental consent,or are they forced on children despite objections from the parents?Is it a separate course from which pupils can be excused,or is it integrated into many classes so parents can't find out when it's given?Well,just some things for you to ponder.Give us a call with your experiences.We want to hear from you at 1-800-736-3202.

**spk_0:** [01:11.93 - 01:27.60] Our guest today is Leanna Benn of Spokane,Washington,who is the author and director of a program called Teen Aid.I had the pleasure of visiting her.Offices a couple of years ago when I was in Spokane and I'm very much impressed with what she's doing and she's

**spk_1:** [01:27.60 - 01:30.27] on the line with us from Spokane,Washington right now.

**spk_0:** [01:30.37 - 01:39.88] Hello Leanna,are you there?Well,thank you for joining us today.Uh,tell us about your program,your sex ed program called Teen Aid.

**spk_2:** [01:40.61 - 03:13.07] Well,our program is abstinence based where we promote family values and we connect the parents and and teenagers together to talk about.The value laden issues that are so prevalent in the area of sexuality and family life education programs.We have a junior high program that is being tested by the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs,a federally funded organization,and we also have a senior high program that's been around for several years that we have some.Um,casual data that has shown it to be very effective in preventing pregnancies,and we also have a parent workshop that,uh,seems to be,uh,we haven't tested it as far as,uh,making parents more effective,but we know that it encourages parents to talk to their teenagers and we know that that's one of the main deterrents of teen pregnancy.Um,we also have another kind of program that isn't,um,directly related that I would like to share a bit about,and that is we have Affiliates or small chapters,uh,in different parts of the United States and Canada that have a community outreaches that do presentations and meet needs within their community so that it is not just a curriculum,um,it is an organization.It is meant to replace a multifaceted organization.That has different needs and desires for our children,but this is a social service agency that has a curriculum that allows parents to be involved and gives wholesome information to children.

**spk_0:** [03:13.15 - 03:17.89] Well,tell me now,is your course teen aid actually used in public schools?

**spk_2:** [03:18.19 - 03:32.26] Yes,it is.I think it's used in about every state in the country.We've sold it in every state and we've sold it in all 10 Canadian provinces.It's used widely in Canada and we've sold it in several foreign.Countries and it's been translated into two foreign languages.

**spk_0:** [03:32.37 - 03:35.98] Have you any idea how many public schools in the United States use it?

**spk_2:** [03:36.37 - 04:17.90] It's really,uh,we're in the process of sending out a questionnaire to our most recent customers.We've been selling the program for 8 years now in public schools,but schools come and go,and it only takes a teacher to leave from the classroom that liked the program to have the program dismantled and disassembled,so.These programs fluctuate a lot more than we think they do.And so sometimes they'll teach them one year and not the next,and then they'll come up with them the next.So I,I,I don't want to say how many they are.We have 17 grant sites in our federal project in 5 states here in the West,um,that are using the program the way we,uh,hope that they will be using it.

**spk_0:** [04:18.02 - 04:32.15] Now when you say you sell it.Uh,what is it?Is this a copy of the curriculum and how much is it?And do you have to sell one for every pupil,or do you have to sell one every new year that a course is used in a different class?

**spk_2:** [04:32.43 - 04:54.55] Well,no,we didn't do a very good job of marketing,Phyllis.Uh,what we have is one book that a teacher can use,and they can virtually do,um,a school with no more than 2 teachers' copies.And the 2 health teachers or 3 health teachers in a building or or social science teachers,whatever they put wherever the subject is placed can do the program with that material.

**spk_0:** [04:54.67 - 04:59.59] Well then she can use it every year and they can use it.You mean she doesn't have to buy it again the next year.No,

**spk_2:** [04:59.67 - 05:32.95] they don't.The only thing that we,we hope that they will buy,and sometimes they don't understand this.Uh,in the education profession is we have what we call parenting communicators or parent grams,and that's what sends the values transmission home for the parents to discuss in the privacy of their own home,and we hope that they will buy those,but we know that that doesn't always happen,and we know that a lot of schools,uh,plagiarize them and send them home as they've rewritten them.And even though I don't want to encourage that,I know that it happens,and it means that kids and parents are talking together now.

**spk_0:** [05:33.00 - 05:35.31] What grade level is this curriculum designed for?

**spk_2:** [05:35.43 - 05:49.84] Well,we have a,we have a,we have a scope and sequence of our program for junior high that can be used in 7th,8th,and 9th grade,the same book.And we have a scope and sequence to use the senior high in at least 2 grade levels in senior high.

**spk_0:** [05:49.95 - 05:52.29] All right,now,how much class time does this take,

**spk_2:** [05:52.84 - 06:38.19] um,depending on the,on the instructor,but it takes between,um,10 and,uh,20 hours,an average of about 15 hours,and it's not all on sex.That's one of the things that I'd like to clarify.We talk about experiencing.Love and dating,reproductive anatomy.We talk about sexually transmitted diseases,but we also talk about parenting,family,how to care for the elderly.We talk about how to,uh,how to look at media objectively and what kind of messages are being given to us on the media.We talk about peer pressure,how to refuse certain activities.We talk about drugs and alcohol,nutrition and exercise as a whole.Whole lifestyle of being in charge of taking good care of your health.

**spk_0:** [06:38.35 - 07:04.44] Well,you've described what is often called family life education in the schools or or sometimes home economics.I always thought home economics was cooking and sewing,but home economics seems to be sex in a lot of schools now.Yes,it does.So your,uh,your curriculum would,would fill that need and it can be done.Uh,concentrated over a couple of weeks or it could be dragged out,uh,one session a week for the whole term.Is that right?

**spk_2:** [07:04.60 - 07:24.54] That's exactly right.And schools do it in a variety of ways,and they usually embed it like in home ec,they embed it in their,uh,child growth and development class,and they may expand the section on parenting for 2 or 3 weeks and use other materials,but then they go back to the teenage materials when they go back into media and those kinds of other issues.

**spk_0:** [07:25.00 - 07:51.74] Now we're going to be taking calls,uh,very shortly on this program,but before we do,I,I wanna ask you a couple of questions because one of the first things that comes to mind is when you say you're teaching abstinence,uh,are you really teaching religion,uh,come what comes along,uh,people who will say,uh,you're interfering with the separation of church and state if you're just teaching children abstinence and,uh,not teaching them how to engage in all of these fun sexual activities.

**spk_2:** [07:52.55 - 08:32.72] Well,I know you're an attorney,but I have twisted the separation of church and state around to make people understand that what teenage does is we leave out some of those controversial topics like contraception.Like promoting abortion,masturbation,homosexuality in deference to the separation of church and state,because there's such a continuum of young people,a diversity of religions in any given classroom that if we were to talk about those issues at all,we would violate both children and their families on the left and the right in.Of the spectrum and therefore we let those be done in the home with direction from our parent grams.

**spk_0:** [08:32.99 - 08:35.89] So you don't discuss those issues at all.Just leave them out.

**spk_2:** [08:36.11 - 08:57.60] We leave them out.We will answer questions or we recommend that the teachers,when we do teacher workshops that they answer the questions for the students if they are appropriate to be answered,if they are personal or value oriented.We recommend that the teacher answer them by saying,Uh,that's a,that's a question that your family values should be discussed in regards to please talk to your parents.

**spk_0:** [08:57.89 - 09:33.47] Well,that's a very interesting approach.I don't think I've heard that in,in any other sex ed course.Uh,usually they say that if the fundamentalist parent comes along and wants to prohibit the teaching of abortion,and contraceptives,homosexuality,and masturbation.Then the fundamentalist parent is imposing his religious values on the rest of the children,but your view is that any discussion of that is necessarily value laden,uh,necessarily encroaches on people's moral views one way or the other,and therefore it's better left out of the classroom.

**spk_2:** [09:33.81 - 10:35.84] Let me give you an example of that.Let's use the issue of masturbation.If,if a young person is told in the classroom that it's OK except when it's done in public,which is a stand that is taken by many public school classroom curricula.We violate those parents on on one end who say that you have to confess that it's a sin or you have to confess it before a board of elders even or if we say don't do it too often,which some church groups will say,as long as you don't do it too often it's OK,well how do you define too often because the family needs to define that.Or if you say that as long as you don't do it too often,Um,we have some parents on the other end of the spectrum who say that they want their children to practice that as much as they can so that they will be sexually adjusted for marriage.And we've told them that we say not to do it too often,and their parents are saying do it often because you're adjust it will help you be adjusted.We've violated those parents' values,uh,not only in masturbation,but we do that in all the other issues as well.

**spk_0:** [10:36.58 - 11:00.62] Well,I must say I find it very difficult to discuss some of these subjects on the radio and in public,uh,but the problem is if anybody is listening to this program and you find this uh inappropriate topic to be discussed,uh,remember that uh we are,we are adults and what we're talking about is material that is put before really very young children in the classroom and you ought to know what is being done.

**spk_2:** [11:01.12 - 11:38.15] Well,and I know that both you and I have some areas that we will not discuss on the air,um,that our children are being um given information about in the public school classroom on a regular basis,and most of our children receive sex education.Um,from 4th or 5th grade on up every single year,and it becomes more and more in-depth,um,and explicit and more explicit,and it's done in mixed company with only one adult present usually and therefore oftentimes the,the tone of it is,uh,ruled by how rowdy,uh,students may become.

**spk_0:** [11:38.80 - 11:48.80] Well,it's also done in the classroom with,uh,pictures and,uh,slides and,uh,pictures in books and videos and and models

**spk_2:** [11:48.80 - 12:05.54] of actual size with uh pubic hair that actually disseminate fluid and they're being,uh,sent out as flyers for sex educators all over the country to be ordered for mail order and,um,we have them used in the public school classrooms here in Washington state.

**spk_0:** [12:06.45 - 13:06.17] We all know that when you see something visually and particularly in Living Color on television,it has a far greater impact on the viewer,uh,than if you simply talk about it or read it out of a book.Now I wanna ask you another question,Leanna,when we're going to callers on this subject,uh,right after the break,but,uh,uh,you mentioned at one point during our discussion the matter of evaluation.Uh,my experience with all of these sex education courses which are taught so widely in public schools across the country is that most of them have never been evaluated and,uh,we had quite a controversy in our Illinois legislature this year where we passed a law requiring evaluation.Uh,the,uh,the people who were involved in these courses,Planned Parenthood,the National Education Association,and others fought this law very bitterly because they did not want the courses to be evaluated.Would you comment on evaluations that you have,uh,had made of teen aid?

**spk_2:** [13:06.86 - 14:24.03] Well,I,I,before I comment on teenage,I'd like to share with you that,that some of the evaluations that are done with the contraceptive mentality will,some of the,um,leaders will say that we don't think,we don't care or we don't think,and we don't know if this form of education will actually change the teen pregnancy rate.So,um,you need to find out what the basis of their evaluation might be because many times what they're evaluating is.Kids like the program.Did the teacher feel like the materials were adequate to fill up the time allotment?Were there enough videotapes?Was it presented aesthetically?And so many times the evaluation is not on the effectiveness of the program in reducing sexual activity or teen pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases.So I just want to caution you on that.What we looked at in our evaluation were those factors.Can we change kids' attitudes towards abstinent behavior?And I want to say that all education programs do something in changing values one way or the other.You cannot talk about sex without changing values.And we talk about abstinent values,and we encourage that.And we've seen in our research through the federal government that those attitudes are changed by the students in our,in our junior high program.

**spk_0:** [14:24.59 - 14:29.91] You mean changed in terms of abstaining from sexual activity while they're teenagers.

**spk_2:** [14:30.11 - 14:44.38] Their intention to abstain is changed.Also,um,their acceptance and what they think of their peers has changed.They also talk to their parents more because of our program,and that changes values and,and attitudes.Well,

**spk_0:** [14:44.43 - 14:52.91] stand by,Leanna,will you?We have to stop for a break and we'll be back and,uh,take questions from our listeners.After the break,and of

**spk_1:** [14:52.91 - 15:08.96] course we're at 1-800-736-3202.A whole bank of lines open already.Some people filing in to talk to you ladies,students and parents.We'd especially like to hear from you.1-800-736-3202.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_3:** [15:09.35 - 16:09.21] Eagle-Forum is a leader in promoting conservative values,and this holds true regarding our nation's education system.We encourage you.Become a part of our winning team of 80,000 men and women.Do you believe,as we do,we believe our public schools should teach children to read by the 1st grade by the proven phonics method.Of course we believe in teaching the proven success of traditional family values,moral behavior,the American Constitution,and the private free enterprise system.And let's teach reading,writing,spelling,grammar,arithmetic skills,and the essentials of history.and science before we exhaust money and time on non-academic subjects to become a part of a team that's making a difference in preserving traditional values in the family and education,write Eagle-Forum for a membership application.Send $15 to Eagle-Forum,that's Eagle like the American Eagle,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Alton A L T O N,Illinois,62002.

**spk_4:** [16:13.86 - 16:49.70] from the north to the south we're standing.From the fields to the factories we'll shout the word about our constitution is still standing.Kept us.It's made people And Like High above the cloud.

**spk_1:** [17:09.94 - 17:40.47] Live via satellites on the USA Radio Network.Welcome back to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Phyllis,this is an awfully controversial subject,but we need to talk about it sex courses in public schools,and of course we wanna hear from you at 1-800-736-32.02 that's 1-800-736-3202.Come on in.Oh,ready to jump into callers.Let's go to St.Louis first,and there's Curtis over our flagship station.Hello KSIB.

**spk_0:** [17:41.08 - 17:44.00] Hello,Curtis.What is your question or comment?Hi,I was

**spk_1:** [17:44.00 - 17:44.62] just wondering,

**spk_0:** [17:44.64 - 18:15.42] um.Ms.Ben had mentioned the,uh,the curriculum that she was using was,um,um,teacher's manuals,and I just was thinking about the curriculum that we'd,uh,used in high school and some of the things that,uh,we were showing were rather explicit.And I would,I would guess that the,uh,The manuals that she would have wouldn't be so explicit rather,but,uh,I was wondering if she could just give a little more information about the,uh,the manuals that she has.Uh,yes,uh,are you there,Leanna?Yes,I am.OK.How would you like to answer that?Well,

**spk_2:** [18:15.50 - 18:56.91] our manual is the information that the teachers need to teach the students,so there's a great deal of background information.It is not explicit.As a matter of fact,we are in a,um,disagreement with our own state AIDS office as to what is medically accurate because We refuse to delineate and explain,uh,specific homosexual sex acts in our book.And,um,we just want to caution kids about being sexually active.We don't want to go into the explicit terms.So we're,uh,we have even come under attack because we do not want to violate those students in the classroom.nor the teachers that want to teach those students.

**spk_0:** [18:57.35 - 19:16.03] Well,my guess is that most of the listeners to this program could not even comprehend how explicit some of the videos,the pictures,the models,and the discussions are in,um,in,in thousands of these sex courses that are given in the public schools without prior parental knowledge or consent.

**spk_2:** [19:17.10 - 19:40.03] Well,many of the concepts are so,um,out,out to lunch,so to speak,that they wouldn't be able to understand them.One book that we were just going through the other day,um,that's used in the Virginia classroom says that,um,that a pimp is someone who manages prostitutes.And,uh,it's those kinds of ideas that you think,well,you know,they're talking about prostitution.Why does

**spk_0:** [19:40.03 - 19:41.63] the 4th grader need to know that?

**spk_2:** [19:41.99 - 20:01.34] Well,I,I'm not sure that they can understand managing is sort of,I mean,I think of managing a,a,a,a,a business or a company.Uh,management,uh,is a,is a,uh,certainly a good occupation.Um,and pimps are legitimized in that curriculum by saying that they manage prostitutes.Well,

**spk_0:** [20:01.42 - 20:19.94] I have seen sex ed courses used in the public schools which say that,uh,prostitution should be legalized,uh,that homosexuality is an OK lifestyle,and it,it simply validates and approves all of these acts and furthermore says you should not be judgmental or critical of any of them.

**spk_2:** [20:21.26 - 20:46.59] We've seen a lot of that and we even have seen critiques saying that our program should encourage abortion,and they're very disconcerted because we encourage adoption.And,uh,that's part of what the Title 2 program through the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Program requires,but it also is a very viable option and a very positive one for young women that we work with in our office.And um well,

**spk_0:** [20:46.60 - 21:04.02] it has been very interesting to me to discover that the people who are for abortion are very anti-adoption.They're not even neutral about it.They they have taught the the people who listen to their propaganda that it's better to kill the unborn baby than it is to give it away.

**spk_2:** [21:05.04 - 21:39.76] They begin giving statistics that it's healthier,and they,they give emotional reasons why it's healthier.And yet it doesn't take very much thought to understand that the baby doesn't go to anybody when it's aborted.And we try to get the kids to look at long-term solutions,long-term healthy lifestyles rather than the short-term quick fix solutions that we have in our culture.And that's one of the things our program does.And maybe that's why sometimes people don't understand,uh,a value-based program because we're not just telling kids how to get out of the situation for today.We're trying to give them lifelong.Skills

**spk_1:** [21:40.16 - 21:48.03] toll-free number from anywhere in America today 1-800-736-3202.Here's Anne for you,Phyllis.

**spk_0:** [21:48.12 - 21:51.09] Hello,Anne.What,what is your question or comment?

**spk_5:** [21:51.20 - 22:08.84] You know,it's really disconcerting to hear the types of things that are being taught in the schools today.Um,could you please tell me how early they're teaching children about abortion versus adoption and when does that start becoming a part of the curriculum?It's almost as though it's being ingrained that,uh,this is a lifestyle that they should choose.Do you know when they start teaching that?

**spk_0:** [22:09.41 - 22:31.62] Uh,well,I would say from my experience in reading a lot of uh these courses that they want to teach sex education as they say K through 12.Now there isn't any other subject that's taught for 13 years,not reading,writing,arithmetic,history,or math,uh,but,uh,they.They force it on the children at a very young age,but let's ask Leanna what she would like to comment on that.

**spk_2:** [22:31.91 - 22:51.21] Well,I think specifically about abortion and adoption.They begin discussing those subjects in 4th and 5th grade when they begin discussing the topic of intercourse,uh,in most of the systems,and,um,I think that that's,uh,probably,you know,10 years old or some of,of,of the kids as early as 9 years old.

**spk_0:** [22:51.60 - 23:12.03] Well,this whole thing of discussing intercourse in the 4th grade is in the 4th grade ought to be learning fractions and something about American history and,and,uh,developing their reading skills and their multiplication table skills,uh.Uh,I,I just think the whole thing is upside down and very contrary to what people want.

**spk_2:** [23:12.35 - 24:16.62] It's contrary to educational principles as well.If I could share that briefly.One of the things we do in education,we have a concept called what you don't use,you lose.And it's a very valid concept,and we teach kids to read,and we expect them to read everything that they can get their hands on street signs,everything from the time we teach them to read.The same is true with arithmetic.We expect them to practice,practice,practice.We postpone teaching them how to drive and driver's education until just before they get their license and get into the class of how to drive.But in sexuality,we tell them.The information as early as 3rd,4th,5th grade,and then we,then,then the educators will say,well,they won't use this information until they're ready.But we've taught them by example and modeled,modeled for them that we want them to practice every skill that we give them.And so,we are teaching them by,uh,modeling for them sexuality behavior that we want them to practice that.Also at a very,very early age and then we're surprised that kids are beginning sexual activity at an earlier age.

**spk_0:** [24:16.94 - 24:55.87] The big rationale for the sex education courses generally is that we have such terrible problems with teenage pregnancy,uh,with children,uh,getting pregnant,having abortions,getting VD,and so forth,and therefore we need education,uh,which is the solution.Uh,but the way I look at it,we've had,uh,we've had general sex education in the public schools for at least 15 years,and,uh,the,the incidence of teenage pregnancies,abortions,VD,and unhappy,broken up lives,uh,has gone sky high during the same period of time.Would you like to comment on that?

**spk_2:** [24:56.61 - 26:26.94] Well,I think that that's very true,and I think the reason is because we're looking at faulty education.We're teaching them methods that have built in failures contraceptives,many of the relationship skills,the decision making skills surely have built in failures because they fail to teach any absolutes.There are absolutes.When you have sex,it is possible to get pregnant.And when they fail to teach absolutes in any of these areas about decision making,certain things are illegal no matter what.Um,those,those kinds of faulty,uh,logic and teaching methods actually cause the built-in failures to happen.And what we're hearing is that it's more and more.It's kind of like throwing,uh,we would,we need liquid on the fire of teen pregnancy.And instead of throwing water,which would be abstinence,we're throwing gasoline or napalm or something else that can be considered liquid.And then we're saying,well,then it must need more liquid,and we get bigger and bigger fires.And it's time that we put out the fires by,by knowing what is in the curriculum that our children are involved in,knowing the ancillary materials,the follow-up,the resources.And then demanding that there be an alternative program given to those students.If you cannot get the,the one out that is,that is amoral,that you have to have an alternative program that will be taught to those students in a way that they,that,that your students will not have to be subjected.to that kind of information.Well,

**spk_0:** [26:27.02 - 26:42.46] when you say you teach abstinence in,in your course,uh,how do you have people who criticize it and say you aren't giving the whole picture,you ought to be teaching contraceptives,you're just imposing your lifestyle on,uh,other people,and how do you handle that?

**spk_2:** [26:43.40 - 26:51.35] Well,I handle that in a couple of ways.First of all,I say that most teens are abstaining,so we're not teaching them something that's very difficult because they've been abstaining for the last 10

**spk_0:** [26:51.35 - 26:51.40] or

**spk_2:** [26:51.40 - 26:51.64] 15.

**spk_0:** [26:51.75 - 26:56.61] Well,now that's not what we're told.We're told that all the,all the teenagers are engaging in sex all the time.

**spk_2:** [26:57.06 - 27:05.42] I know,but if you look at Planned Parenthood statistics,uh,through the.Paris poll or through Guttmacher Institute's polls previously,well,

**spk_0:** [27:05.52 - 27:10.62] they're those polls are certainly not biased in favor of morality and abstinence,

**spk_2:** [27:10.66 - 28:44.08] are they?No,they're not,and they say that about 10 or 15% of the students are having sex under about age 16,but we have expectations that we expect kids to become sexually active.Our culture is expecting that we have to reverse those expectations,especially in light of AIDS.And then we have to,um,get the parents to say,we don't want you to give any expectations that we don't have.And I think that that's a real important issue.The other thing that I say is not only that,that we're teaching kids skills that they already,I mean,that they're already abstaining,but we're going to teach them life skills on how to refuse.Requests to be sexually involved,so we're teaching them refusal skills.We're teaching them a decision making process that has them look at what their community standards are,meaning is it legal?Is it moral?Is it ethical?Does it build relationships?Is it in line with authority and charge?That's a new concept in the public school.But it's a very important concept when we're teaching kids decision making so that they can make long term or decisions that will help them long term.That is a difference in a value-based or directive approach that we use.It is a safety valve approach.And when we're teaching kids that they can be sexually active and not get caught,we're violating many state laws.Laws we're certainly violating many forms of morality in most major religions,and it is not fair because what happens if the woman gets pregnant?She's the one that carries that baby to term.Is that fair for her if she carries that baby to term,either abort,she has complications.All right,

**spk_0:** [28:44.16 - 28:51.53] well,we'll have to continue this conversation after the break and particularly talk about the.Laws about sex for teenagers and

**spk_1:** [28:51.53 - 29:03.41] we want to hear from you.We'll pick up the tab for the telephone call at 1-800-736-3202.1-800-736-3202.We'll return on P Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_6:** [29:03.85 - 30:04.65] Radio Live with Phyllis-Schlafly brings you important news every week,highlighting different problems in the public schools.You can order a cassette on any one of these programs for $5.Here are some of the interesting topics that are available on cassette.Home schooling,early childhood education,the USSoviet agreement,school board policies,global education,sex education,censorship.The National Education Association,illiteracy,quest,AIDS education,death education,witchcraft,suicide education,and the new age.Informative guest speakers discuss these topics with Phyllis,and callers share their firsthand experiences.For a 60 minute cassette copy of any of these important school issues,send $5 to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [30:14.83 - 30:38.60] Live via satellites across America,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we're talking about sex education in the classrooms.Do you agree or disagree?And actually we're sorting out all the ramifications and of course your input is vital.1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.

**spk_0:** [30:38.96 - 31:35.18] When we went to the break,we were talking about the law and telling uh teenagers.These courses on sex,uh,that some things are against the law,and,uh,Lena,I just happened to be looking at this moment,uh,to a list of the laws in one of the states.It isn't yours,but it's another state and it lists the sexual offenses and,uh,which are all against the law.It includes rape,tech sex with a teenager,fornication,crimes against nature,seduction,prostitution,detaining a person for prostitution.Keeping or frequenting a bawdy place,adultery,incest,homosexual marriages,bigamy,and taking indecent liberties.Now it would seem to me at the very least that they ought to be able to teach children what is against the law,just as they can teach them that it's against the law to take drugs.What about that,Leanna?

**spk_2:** [31:36.40 - 32:25.18] But that is part of what helped our program in San Marcos do so well is that they did bring in the legal aspects of,of drug use and of sexuality as they were talking to the kids about the advantages of abstinence because it's a legal option.And,um,I think that I taught in the juvenile detention system here in Spokane for 2 years myself,our program on abstinence and worked with many of the prostitutes and Uh,juvenile rapists in the area,and they do not understand why sex is a violation of somebody else.When they begin to understand that,they can begin to understand why what they did was wrong,and that helps them in their,um,Um,reconciliation process so that they don't go out and do the crime again.

**spk_0:** [32:25.56 - 32:27.92] All right,let's go to a caller.Sheila is standing

**spk_1:** [32:27.92 - 32:29.48] by in Dallas,Texas.Hello,

**spk_0:** [32:29.64 - 32:33.35] Sheila.What is your question or comment?Well,Mrs.Schlaffly,

**spk_2:** [32:33.39 - 32:57.15] um,I would like to find out how parents who are concerned about what their children are learning in school can approach the teachers and the principals in the attempt to try to get abstinence education into the schools.Um,parents,uh,that I've talked to have encountered some resistance because,uh,teachers seem to think that the only way to go is,is the

**spk_0:** [32:57.15 - 32:57.39] way

**spk_2:** [32:57.39 - 33:07.53] that the Planned Parenthood method that's been in the schools for.Last 25 years,how can parents get this thing into the schools effectively and teach abstinence?

**spk_0:** [33:07.72 - 33:35.83] Well,one answer to that question is a very fine booklet that Eagle-Forum has,uh,published by the Department of Education on how parents can cope with the issue of sex ed.As a matter of fact,it was written by the former Undersecretary of Education Lis Wright,who used to be,I think,the superintendent of the Dallas school system.But let's ask Leanna what is her question for how parents listening to this program.Can get your program or any abstinence-based program in their local public schools.

**spk_2:** [33:36.15 - 34:12.68] Well,I think the Lioness Wright book is excellent as far as technique goes,but one of the things that we need to remember is that the teachers in those districts and superintendents and so forth have been taught a whole different viewpoint,and they have not questioned it with statistics or any of those kinds of things.We need to remember that they have a goal.Of the in their life,or most of them do,of helping children,and they feel that they're doing the best that they can.So we have to handle that very gently and not bruise their ego and not bruise the things that they understand.

**spk_0:** [34:12.89 - 34:21.36] And well,that's nice.I believe in being tactful and polite,but I,I wish some of them were sensitive to the matter of not bruising the ego of parents.

**spk_2:** [34:21.78 - 35:21.87] We have to,well,we have the truth,and they don't.And so sometimes we have to go the extra mile in a.Helping them understand,and I think giving them the information,giving them a copy of a book,then asking their opinion about it,having parents be able to articulate the reasons why,giving them a rationale that is,that's very important,having parents write down exactly what they're saying,holding those meetings in a way,you know,I mean public meetings occur once you begin this process,holding those meetings in ways that will encourage the parents to write down and and justify what they say.That does not mean that the school district is going to reciprocate because there are good teachers in every district,but there's also a mentality that is out there that says we're going to get every kid,every kid to contracept and that those children connected to their parents are.Somehow defective because they've not emerged as real people.

**spk_0:** [35:22.02 - 35:24.36] All right,let's try another question,Leanna

**spk_1:** [35:24.50 - 35:37.16] and Sheila,thank you for the telephone call.That means there's another line open for you at 1-800-736-3202.Come on into the conversation.Here's Tony in Indianapolis over at WXIR.

**spk_0:** [35:37.32 - 35:39.40] Hello,Tony,what is your question or comment?

**spk_1:** [35:40.31 - 36:05.32] Hello,Tony.Well,Tony doesn't seem to be there.Oh,Phyllis,before we do jump into more calls here,I had a burning question on my mind.I recently read 85% of public school parents in a nationwide poll I'm talking about indicated that the public schools should teach a family sex education courses.I mean,how do you deny these parents who want such a program in the schools?

**spk_0:** [36:05.41 - 37:07.45] Well,that 85% doesn't impress me at all because all the same polls show that more than.90% of the American people would like to have a prayer in the public schools,and we know the court has said that that's an interference with the rights of the tiny minority who don't want the prayer and it's interesting about the prayer analogy because not only has the Supreme Court held that the child does not have to pray,uh,they also have held that it is an offense to that child who doesn't want to pray,uh,that his peers are standing around praying.And in order to avoid embarrassment,uh,everybody else has to be silenced.Now these same people come along and say too bad if you're the one in the class who doesn't want to hear an explicit discussion of sex,uh,you just have to sit there and listen because they want to,uh,impose,uh,these Planned Parenthood and the rest want to impose their,uh,lifestyle and their teaching on other people's children.

**spk_1:** [37:07.77 - 37:09.07] Leanna,anything to add to that?

**spk_0:** [37:11.24 - 37:13.82] Leanna,are you still with us?Yes,I am.OK,

**spk_2:** [37:14.04 - 38:00.67] I,I agree it's,it's a,it's a crazy situation,but I,I think we need to begin to understand that the,that there's a whole system,a whole network of people producing this sort of propaganda,if you will,of,of statistics.And if you look into what those parents really mean when they say they want family life education and you get them to define it.As you refine those statistics,you find that what they want is a positive pro-family values program,one that that substantiates their authority in the family and the and their family structure.And so what they really want is a program like teenager sex respect,not a Planned Parenthood program that promotes homosexuality and contraception.

**spk_0:** [38:00.91 - 38:37.24] Well,it's Planned Parenthood as a pressure group that has talked.The Virginia legislature,for example,into mandating that sex ed has to be taught in all the schools,and this has caused an enormous upheaval.They had,uh,some weeks ago they had 1000 people show up at the school board meeting in Virginia Beach.That would be a large number of people in New York City,but it certainly was a big number in Virginia Beach.And this is because Planned Parenthood has come in,uh,in collusion with the National Education Association and tried to force this type of.Explicit sex ed,uh,even in the elementary grade and Phyllis,

**spk_1:** [38:37.28 - 38:43.16] what is the National Education Association's position about the whole matter of sex education?

**spk_0:** [38:43.28 - 39:15.04] Well,the NEA passed a resolution at its annual convention last summer,uh,saying that they want the public schools to teach sex courses to every child,including birth control,diversity of sexual orientation,and incest,and they emphasize that this ought to be done with or without.Parental consent at every age because the NEA thinks it's the right of every individual,that means including children,to live in an environment of freely available information,knowledge,and wisdom about sexuality.And let's take

**spk_1:** [39:15.04 - 39:19.56] another call at 1-800-736-3202.Here's Dwayne Phyllis.

**spk_0:** [39:19.68 - 39:35.37] Hello Dwayne.What is your question or comment?I was wondering what kind of a response she's had from the NEA.Have they been supporting the program or have they brought up any?Any problems for?Oh,good question,Leanna.I,I wonder if the NEA is one of your endorsers.

**spk_2:** [39:36.39 - 40:16.06] Well,we have several endorsers.The NEA is not one of them.The PTA has endorsed our program and the National School Board Association has endorsed our program,but not the,not the NEA.As a matter of fact,what is happening right now is that there are coalitions being Built to help stop censors and our program and many other programs and all parents are considered censors when in fact it is the education establishment that is doing the censoring and they're using things like sex bias,the position that's taken on giving information on what happens in an abortion.Uh,fetal development is considered a controversial topic.

**spk_0:** [40:16.16 - 40:19.40] Well,we'll get back to that after the next break,and this

**spk_1:** [40:19.40 - 41:19.07] is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Are your elected officials babies' best friends?Do they support legislation that would protect the lives of unborn babies?They need to hear from you on this crucial issue.Eagle-Forum has a way to help you do exactly this.We have available a plastic baby rattle embossed with the words Baby's best friend.This is just the item to send your congressmen,senators,state legislators,or governor to remind them that you want them to be baby's best friend by voting and working for pro-life legislation.To order your baby rattles,write Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002 and send 50 cents for each rattle.That's 2 for $1.10 for $5.This is a great way to show your representatives that they have your support in all efforts to pass pro-life legislation.Send 50 cents per rattle to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_7:** [41:19.69 - 42:18.36] Too many children have been cheated out of the education they deserve.Did you know that nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science?That's a problem we can no longer afford to ignore.Educational excellence in the public school starts with respect for the rights of students,parents,and taxpayers.But what are they?Every student has the right to be taught to read the English language in the first grade.Every student has the right to family privacy,the right to his religious faith and beliefs,the right to share information with his parents.The student's Bill of Rights,get your copy from Eagle-Forum.Learn more about the rights you and your children should expect.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy by writing Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [42:21.12 - 42:36.73] Live via satellites on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we're trying lots of response on the whole matter of sex education in the public school classrooms.Let's jump back into the telephone calls.We try Tony again in Indianapolis over WXIR.

**spk_0:** [42:36.93 - 42:40.43] Hello Tony.What is your question or comment?I had a

**spk_8:** [42:40.43 - 42:54.75] question,uh.That,uh,I had been taught that in school when I was in school and so before I became a Christian,I didn't think there was anything wrong with that,so I just went along with what they taught you.But now that I'm

**spk_0:** [42:55.97 - 42:56.50] what was it they taught you?

**spk_8:** [42:56.83 - 43:42.60] Well,that,uh,you know,as long as you did what you were doing with somebody that you cared deeply about and it wasn't.A lot of people,but just,you know,you could do it with several different people.You didn't necessarily have to wait till you got married.And now that I'm married,I was just trying to figure out because it has caused me problems as far as now,you know,it,it kind of robs you of what you would have when you're married because now it's like old,old to you maybe or and it kind of,you know,does that course teach kids about how,how it'll affect you later,which things I never thought it would happen to me,you know.It kind of steals.I don't know what you would,it's like.

**spk_0:** [43:43.71 - 44:06.51] Well,thank you for saying that and I think you've described exactly what is taught in sex ed courses all over the country.Uh,they teach them that anything you want to do that you feel comfortable with or feel loving about is OK and not only isn't it OK,it really robs you of the wonderful marriage that you can have later with somebody very special.Leanna,would you like to comment on that?

**spk_2:** [44:06.75 - 44:37.98] Well,in our section where we talk about the advantage.of abstinence both in junior and senior high,we talk about one of the advantages is having greater trust in marriage and having a better relationship and having the skills to have fidelity within your own marriage relationship as one of those advantages of postponing that involvement,and I think that the collar has really hit the nail on the head as far as it does cheat kids,it does cheat people.They have no way to know that it's going to be harmful until afterwards and We need to give them that information in advance so that we can help them.

**spk_0:** [44:38.05 - 44:46.05] And there's a recent survey that showed that those who have sex before marriage have a much higher divorce rate than those who don't.Listeners over

**spk_1:** [44:46.05 - 44:51.82] at WCHR,welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we bring you Abby from Princeton,New Jersey.

**spk_0:** [44:51.98 - 46:41.06] Hello,Abby.What is your question or comment?Well,I just have a comment.I find it very interesting that there are no opinions of actual teenagers on your show live.Are you a teenager?Yes,I am.Well,give us your opinion.I,I think that,um,I know firsthand that abstinence education is absolutely ridiculous.There's no way teenagers are going to stop having sex because the temptation is just too great.If you really want to stop the spread of disease and decrease teen pregnancy,I think the so-called Planned Parenthood method is really your only option.Well,that's,that's an interesting point of view,but,uh,don't you think it's quite a reflection on your attitude that you say you can't control yourself?Don't you believe,don't you believe in,in willpower and,uh,listen to me here.I can personally control myself and I plan to wait until marriage.Well,if you can do it,then anybody else can do it.Well,if I,yeah,but see,my point is that a lot of people just aren't going to.Well,but we should tell them the advantages of waiting and we should teach them that they can do it.I just feel my opinion is that it's just not going to happen.Well,even the surveys of Planned Parenthood and the Guttmacher Institute show that at age 18,half of the young people are virgins.Now,if half of them can be virgins,then the other half can too.OK,and I'm glad you're in the right half.And if you can do it,don't you think others could be inspired to do likewise?I think that they could.I think that they certainly could,but I just feel that,I mean,from my peers,from,um,you know,things like that,I just feel that it's not going to happen well.I think that you really have to try and be realistic.Well,you could make the same argument about taking drugs.A lot of them are going to take drugs,but they still need to be told by responsible authorities that it's wrong,bad,unhealthy,and illegal,don't you think?Well,I guess we just disagree on this.Well,I appreciate your call anyway.Let's see if Leanna has a comment on this.

**spk_2:** [46:41.68 - 46:56.93] Well,I think that And the fact that the caller can can control herself and can see the advantage for herself says that someone's been doing abstinence education with her and,and her parents need to be,um,commended that they've at least talked to her about that issue.

**spk_1:** [46:57.28 - 47:05.08] I can't understand why she's so opposed to even presenting your point of view,Phyllis.It's amazing.We move on to Joan in Saint Louis over KSIV.

**spk_0:** [47:05.28 - 48:07.29] Hello,Joan,what is your question or comment?Oh,well,I wanted to make a comment.That the federal government funds many of the sex ed programs.Most of them are funding the Planned Parenthood type philosophy program,about 95% of them.OK.And we know they're not healthy from the emotional standpoint and as well as the legal standpoint,but Senator Kennedy is attempting to eliminate funding for the teeny weeny part of the programs which are based on abstinence.It's the Senate Bill 110.And we should be writing letters to our senators asking that they do not eliminate funding for the sex ed programs that teach abstinence.You're absolutely right,and we thank you for calling that to our attention.Uh,the pitiful few dollars that go to the abstinence-based education like teenage and sex respect,uh,Senator Ted Kennedy would like to wipe out through Senate Bill 110.And make sure that the federal government funds only the Planned Parenthood style.Bob's waiting for you,Phyllis.Hello,Bob.What is your question or comment?

**spk_8:** [48:07.46 - 48:21.88] Well,as an NEA member myself,there are two things that NEA members can do to resolve the problem.One,stay in the union.2,run for offices and take the union back.Get rid of some of these resolutions.

**spk_0:** [48:22.65 - 48:31.01] Well,those are very constructive suggestions.Thank you for and I,I hope there'll be more of you who will go to the next convention and rescind some of these bad resolutions.

**spk_8:** [48:31.09 - 48:34.31] That's the only way to do it is to take the authority and stewardship back.

**spk_0:** [48:35.10 - 48:47.38] Well,we appreciate that comment and I hope there are a lot of NEA members who will hear this and realize that they do not,uh,support the,the,uh,resolution that was passed at the convention last summer and try to change it,Leanna.

**spk_2:** [48:47.94 - 49:22.45] Phyllis,I'd like to comment on the,um,Senator Kennedy's bill.I think it's very important that those letter writers also talk to,uh,Senator Kennedy about,uh,bringing out the report that was commissioned by his,uh,group,uh,written by Stan Weed to give,uh,direction on policy and an understanding of what works and what doesn't work,and they have failed to bring that about or to bring it out and to make that a real public issue.And he was commissioned to do that.Stan Weed was,and I think it'd be very important for us to have those kinds of documentations read into the Congressional Record.

**spk_0:** [49:22.66 - 49:37.30] Well,thank you very much,and we're out of time.Leanna Benn,the author and director of the program called Teen Aid in Spokane,Washington.If you would like to know more about it,you.You can write us.We appreciate your being with us today,Leanna,

**spk_1:** [49:37.44 - 49:55.01] and be listening for the same topic over many of these stations on the Phyllis-Schlafly Report.Phyllis,we want some perspective on this whole matter.You'll do it in a unique way,I'm sure,and we'll have it in just a couple moments live via satellites on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_9:** [50:00.01 - 50:56.12] The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,a place where the most powerful man in the world resides,the president of the United States.But what many Americans don't know is that some of our nation's most important decisions aren't made in the Oval Office.Because according to the Constitution,the power to make laws was granted only to Congress and not to the president.That's why only Congress can declare war,raise and support armies,and approve treaties.The bill is passed.The Constitution,the words we live by.To receive a free copy of this great document and information about it,write Constitution,Washington DC 200063999.A message from the commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution and the Advertising Council.

**spk_6:** [50:58.16 - 51:56.59] Informing the public about real issues in education today,that's the job of Radioive with Phyllis-Schlafly.But we need your help.Encourage your friends to listen to the program and thank this station for carrying it.Get your friends a cassette copy of this program.Give a subscription of the education reporter to your church or child's teacher.And don't forget about our packets that accompany information discussed on the program each week.Packets are available for $10 each on topics such as AIDS education,sex education,new age education,drug education,Quest,the NEA,and more.Send $5 for cassettes and $10 for packets to Eagle-Forum.Alton,Illinois 62002.Remember to specify the date of the program and topic when you order.That's $5 for cassettes and $10 for packets to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_0:** [51:58.69 - 52:38.52] Most of the courses taught about sex in the public schools in the last 15 years have been non-directive,non-judgmental,very explicit.They've taught children how to engage in sex,how to participate,but they haven't told them that they ought to wait for a license before they get started.Doing it,Eagle-Forum has a very excellent packet on sex education that is available for $10.We invite you to write for it.It has this very fine booklet on how parents can deal with this course when it comes up in their local schools.Write me and you can get it and tune in next week when we're going to be talking about environmental education,a new course in the schools.
