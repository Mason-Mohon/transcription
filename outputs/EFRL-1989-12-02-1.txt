**spk_0:** [00:01.96 - 00:09.48] The Russians are coming to American colleges,and many of our students are being given a lot of false impressions about the Soviet system.

**spk_1:** [00:10.72 - 00:49.30] Welcome to Phyllis Schlaffly Live on the USA Radio Network and across America.Bruce Hayes here inviting you to stay with us for the next hour.The University of Pittsburgh recently played host to 250 Russian leaders for a remarkable exchange of discussions on the political and cultural issues.It caused quite a stir in the local Pittsburgh media but didn't get.Much coverage nationally.We won't be taking your calls today,but we think you'll be very interested in our special guest today who attended the meetings with the Russians and is ready to tell our national radio audience what really happened.

**spk_0:** [00:49.55 - 01:16.92] Marjorie Provin is a television talk show host and producer on a Christian television station in Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania.It's called Focus.On the issues and it's been running for 9 years.I've been a guest on that program a couple of times.Uh,well,as a reporter,Marjorie attended this unique event which took place last month at the University of Pittsburgh,of which Marjorie is a graduate.It was called Chautauqua at Pitt,

**spk_1:** [01:16.93 - 01:19.36] and she's on the line with us from Pittsburgh.Phyllis,

**spk_0:** [01:19.56 - 01:29.73] hello,Marjorie,thank you for joining us today.And it's so interesting that you attended this event called Chautauqua at Pitt.Tell us what that means.Well,

**spk_2:** [01:29.92 - 02:02.29] Chautauqua at Pitt was held at the University of Pittsburgh,which,by the way,is a tax funded university,October 29th through November 3rd,and I'll tell you,Phyllis,it was a real eye opener for me and I think for anyone else with an open mind that did attend that meeting.And of course the advanced news releases said that the event would enable 250 Soviet leaders and their American counterparts to meet and discuss,you know,in workshop sessions and so forth,the social,political,cultural issues of interest to both nations.Now these

**spk_0:** [02:02.29 - 02:04.92] were real Russians who came over from Russia for the event.

**spk_2:** [02:05.09 - 02:07.24] They were real Russians,and how

**spk_0:** [02:07.24 - 02:07.95] was their English?

**spk_2:** [02:08.62 - 03:02.75] Their English in most cases was very poor.Or in some cases they could speak no English and they did have to have interpreters there to enable the Pittsburgh host to understand exactly what was being said.And by the way,Phyllis,uh,your listeners may be interested in knowing that there were 4 previous conferences of Chautauqua in the United States.held and now 2 of them were held in the Soviet Union and of course 2 were held in the United States.This was the 5th,and the Soviets particularly did want this to be held at Pittsburgh,the University of Pittsburgh particularly,so that they could have an American experience.They could become closer to the average American.And this is why,uh,the University of Pittsburgh was chosen.

**spk_0:** [03:02.99 - 03:13.91] I suppose they took the name Chautauqua,uh,after the famous place Chautauqua,which was quite a gathering place for lecturers and intellectuals generations ago in New York.

**spk_2:** [03:13.93 - 03:44.89] Uh,that's exactly what Chautauqua,um,does.They have,uh,very,uh,many,they have lecturers that come in each year.Uh,they have a,a symphony,various music programs,and it's sort of taken a,a new,uh,turn since,uh,Daniel Bratton,uh,formerly a college president,has become president of Chautauqua,and they've opened it up now to try to,as they say,dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union.

**spk_0:** [03:45.09 - 03:51.55] Well,in regard to the Chautauqua at Pitt,uh,did it have a lot of publicity,uh,advanced publicity,

**spk_2:** [03:51.93 - 04:31.19] Phyllis,Had so much publicity it was difficult to imagine.One of the local TV commentators on the ABC affiliate in Pittsburgh,for instance,had two Soviets at her home that were attending this meeting,and she would bring the one girl on the evening program.And from time to time and have her,um,you know,expand on what went on in the conference.Fortunately,uh,unfortunately,I suppose for her,uh,the,she couldn't speak,um,a very distinct English.She couldn't articulate too well,and,uh,it was difficult to figure out exactly what she was saying.

**spk_0:** [04:31.43 - 04:35.05] Well,Marjorie,tell us what are some of the big names of the people who attended.

**spk_2:** [04:35.31 - 05:41.69] Right?Well,this is important because they did have a US Senator John Heinz.Uh,they had,uh,Phil Donahue,his wife Marlo Thomas,uh,Geraldine Ferraro,the former vice vice presidential candidate.Now the actor and environmentalist Robert Redford was supposed to be there,and of course he didn't make it.Uh,he sent his regrets the day before,but they did have,uh,Valentina.Tereshkova,who is chairperson of the event,and of course she is the first woman cosmonaut in the Soviet Union.They had Bruce S.Gelb,who is the director of the US Information Agency,and of course,um,for anyone that,that knows anything about Bruce Gelb.Uh,Bruce,um,is,uh,the,with the group,the United States Information Agency that funds and facilitates all activities covered under the US-Soviet educational exchange section of the general agreement of the Geneva conference way back,uh,in November of 1985.So he has been very much behind these various conferences according to those in attendance.

**spk_0:** [05:41.89 - 05:49.01] Well,Marjorie,tell us the names of some of the lectures or the workshops.What kind of subject matter did these meetings cover?

**spk_2:** [05:49.17 - 06:29.01] OK,they covered all kinds of things.Uh,for instance,they had prospects for increases in trade and economic relations,cooperation in outer space.They had the current state of U.S.Soviet relations.They had women,environmental issues,and drug and alcohol abuse programs,but the big thing,Phyllis,um,I noticed the,the,so many of these events had personnel in charge of the particular conference or the The symposium that they would be conducting that had very little disagreement in what they were discussing,and I should mention that this is sort of interesting that

**spk_0:** [06:29.01 - 06:33.93] you're saying that the meetings between the Americans and the Russians were not debates.

**spk_2:** [06:34.65 - 06:54.85] No,in many cases they weren't.In fact,the particular dialogue between So-called US and Soviets that had Vladimir Pozner and Phil Donahue,for instance,were actually almost someone referred to them as practically Lovians because

**spk_0:** [06:54.89 - 06:57.76] you mean Phil Donahue was agreeing with the Russians.Oh definitely,

**spk_2:** [06:57.78 - 07:47.63] and Phil,it was so amazing because Phil.was one that used practically his total amount of time in really lauding and presenting Posner,who was the speaker,to come after him.And in fact,he was,so many people were upset in the audience because Uh,Phil Donahue,you know,kept giving light banter about,you know,the,the marvels of the Soviet Union and,and Pozner,and it,Posner,it was so interesting because he did,uh,say in his talk.That he grew up with copies of J.Edgar Hoover's Masters of Deceit,not only in our living room,but in our bedroom,and he said,no,the last thing anyone in his family wanted to be called was a communist dupe,but he just waxed ecstatic about his.

**spk_0:** [07:48.12 - 08:00.15] Well,therefore,would you say that the theme or the message that's coming across to the students is that Maybe we're communists were bad in the bad old days,but today communists are all peace loving and nice people.

**spk_2:** [08:00.49 - 08:39.94] Oh definitely,he introduced Donahue,by the way,on that light,introduced Posner as he's my pal,the son my mother always wanted to have,and he said he's been to our house.I've been to his.They were,it was just sort of um.Uh,a,a real love-in between these two,speakers that evening.And in fact,I,I was going to say one of the things that Donahue really was taken to task for was his statement,uh,in further along in the evening when he berated the USA for our poor voter turnout.He said that we actually have less than 50% turnout in our elections,whereas the Soviets have a 90% turnout.

**spk_0:** [08:40.02 - 08:44.72] Well,I guess if we punished Americans for not voting,we could get a higher turnout.That's what the Russians do,

**spk_2:** [08:44.92 - 08:59.92] and this is one of the things he didn't,you know,appear to have any knowledge of.And of course this woman really took him to task,and she said exactly what you said,that that if we had the same sort of system that the Soviets had,we would have the same type of voter turnout.

**spk_0:** [09:00.38 - 09:09.36] Well,tell me,what do you think was the was the principal message that's coming across?What were there,3 or 400 people present or 1000?How many people attended this?Well,

**spk_2:** [09:09.82 - 09:28.84] now,in the one program where they had Marlo Thomas and Geraldine Ferraro and another several Soviet women,they,the papers indicated there was,there were approximately 3000 in attendance.Now I would say overall I would think they probably had at least 5000 in attendance.

**spk_0:** [09:28.95 - 09:30.71] Were they mostly students or were they public?

**spk_2:** [09:30.85 - 10:11.18] Um,I would say that in,for instance,in the Marlowe Thomas program,uh,with Geraldine Ferraro,I would say that of that 3000 that that the media stated were there.That probably half of those could have been students.For the most part,uh,they were adults.It almost looked like,for instance,at the first meeting place where they had,um,do you know,uh,Senator Heinz,where they had Representative Bill Coy,Representative Bill Bradley.Uh,they,it was a,uh,I think a major,major part of the audience was adult.It was almost like a theater group.

**spk_0:** [10:11.38 - 10:20.17] All right,now,Marjorie,tell us what,what do you think was the message that these Americans were getting at this meeting.At the University of Pittsburgh,

**spk_2:** [10:20.29 - 10:50.13] well,the main message was the perception,Phyllis,that the USSR is no longer the enemy.The,the people were given the idea that that the Soviets are just like,you know,you and I,they are just like Mr.and Mrs.Average Joe American.And they've got the same problems.This was brought out in their discussions on alcoholism,drug abuse,and this was part and parcel,I believe,of the Security and Intelligence Foundation.

**spk_0:** [10:50.45 - 11:01.95] But we don't have the same problems.Their problem is they have to stand in line 2 hours to get a head of cabbage in order to eat.We have supermarkets and go in and buy what we want.Does anybody point out anything like that?

**spk_2:** [11:02.13 - 11:48.72] Well,do you know what this was pointed out in The human events symposium where an angry former Ukrainian stood up actually,and his name was Zanussky,and he sputtered hogwash after the Soviets got done saying that,um,for instance,the only reason the Baltic states were taken over by the Soviets was because the Latvians and so forth wanted protection against fascism.All right,well,one Ukrainian Citizen in Exile just sputtered hogwash.That's a lie,he said.And this was following Yakovlev's statement that the Baltic states,as I'm the Baltic states,as I mentioned,um,did seek the Soviet Union for protection against fascism.And of course this got nothing but laughs.

**spk_0:** [11:48.83 - 11:56.43] Well,of course we all know that the Baltic states were taken over because Stalin wanted to control the world and as much of it as he could get a hold of,

**spk_2:** [11:56.67 - 12:03.38] right?And I did want to mention also in the,in the symposium with Marlowe Thomas.And now

**spk_0:** [12:03.38 - 12:09.14] Marlo Thomas is Phil Donahue's wife.Did she talk about how oppressed women are in this country?She talked about

**spk_2:** [12:09.14 - 12:31.85] all the negatives of women,you know,how we've been in a prison,a fantasy with walls,and,and it was so ironic because I had been to Beverly Hills several years ago and had seen the home in which she grew up,and I just couldn't believe her attitude on talking about being in a prison raised that way.There's just no.No reason for this.

**spk_0:** [12:31.93 - 12:34.73] And is that because she's married to Phil Donahue?It could

**spk_2:** [12:34.73 - 12:50.29] be.And the interesting thing was when she talks about abortion and all these things,she has no children of her own,and in her statements about the Soviet Union really parallel those of her husband.Her quote was,Nobody knows better than the people of the Soviet Union.Well,

**spk_0:** [12:50.33 - 12:52.82] indeed,that's why they're demonstrating and want to get out.

**spk_2:** [12:52.95 - 13:07.84] That's right.But her concern was with the feminist problems,and she said this is a direct quote.Some 70 years ago,you,the Soviets,launched the boldest revolution of the century,a revolution that not only shook the world but changed it.Our hearts are with you.And well,

**spk_0:** [13:07.85 - 13:13.55] it did,it did change the world,certainly,but not for the better,

**spk_2:** [13:13.69 - 13:21.90] right?Well,I think.Reason some of the reasons that Marlowe has been the recipient of the ACLU's Thomas Paine Award and the Helen Caldecott Awards.

**spk_0:** [13:22.06 - 13:38.98] Well,wasn't there anybody on this program who,who pointed out what's wrong with the Soviet system,how its economy is in total collapse,how its missile force is twice the power of ours,and how they oppress their people.

**spk_2:** [13:39.15 - 14:17.93] P Phyllis,there was of that.And interestingly enough,a Pittsburgh area organization did claim that the Chautauqua Institute and the USSR Friendship Society were part of the,or are part of the Soviet active measures operations in the US.And of course they did send a copy of the FBI report on this indicating as such,uh,to all of the local media,to the trustees of the University of Pittsburgh.To the various Pennsylvania legislators,the,um,senators,the representatives,and they did send out this FBI report that has been introduced at an intelligence committee hearing in Congress.

**spk_0:** [14:18.12 - 14:31.56] So we'll hear a little bit more about that after our commercial break.We're talking with Marjorie Provin,a former teacher and graduate of the University of Pittsburgh,who attended this meeting with the Russians.A few weeks ago

**spk_1:** [14:31.74 - 14:55.44] and indeed it caused quite a stir in Pittsburgh and we're bringing it to the forefront,Phyllis,nationally,as a matter of fact,more guests to come on the issue of Russians at US colleges on the program putting you at the forefront of what's really happening in public education today live via satellites on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_1:** [17:03.51 - 17:09.77] Welcome back to the USA Radio Network's presentation of Phyllis-Schlafly Live.We're talking

**spk_0:** [17:09.77 - 17:54.08] to Marjorie Provin of Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania,a talk show hostess and producer,uh,who attended a very interesting meeting between Americans and Russians held at the University of Pittsburgh.Uh,this program is dedicated to,uh,what's happening with tax-supported institutions and the university.University of Pittsburgh,as Marjorie pointed out,is a tax-supported,uh,university.Uh,it hosted this meeting at which,uh,hundreds or thousands of people were able to,uh,view,uh,a lot of what I would call pro-Soviet propaganda.Uh,just before the break,Marjorie,you were about to tell us about an FBI report,uh,about,uh,what,uh,Soviets are doing in this country.Would you like to explain a little further?

**spk_2:** [17:54.25 - 18:44.88] Yes,I would.I'd like to give those in the,uh,listening audience the conclusion of the FBI report,uh,concerning the Chautauqua US,USSR meetings.It said,quote,The Soviet intelligence officers will continue to target influential American citizens,US government officials,journalists,and political activists.Soviet intelligence is always alert for the opportunity to recruit Americans.Who are in a position to facilitate or assist Soviet active measure operations,unquote.Now,the interesting thing is,Phyllis,I spoke to someone who,uh,does work in the intelligence,uh,area,and they stated that there is a brand new drive to recruit not just the liberals.They found it's much more helpful to them to recruit uh conservatives and of course the really unknowledgeable.

**spk_0:** [18:45.33 - 19:25.19] Now,now,Marjorie,when you say recruit,I want people to understand that that we don't think this type of meeting is going to turn any American into a communist or a pro-Russian,but,uh,what do you really think they're after?For example,uh,I think that what Gorbachev is after today is American money,uh,loans and credits,and,uh,did you see.Any examples of this meeting of how the speakers were encouraging Americans to to invest in the Soviet Union to send their money over,which investments,of course,are all ultimately underwritten by the US taxpayer.

**spk_2:** [19:25.63 - 20:30.83] Definitely,P Phyllis,in the meeting called Prospects for Increases in Trade and Economic relations,the whole thrust.was,uh,from the Soviets that we must repeal the Jackson Vanek Amendment.Now this amendment was set up a number of years ago for a very good reason,and it said that any trade with the USSR must be linked with an improvement in human rights in the Soviet Union.Well,according to,uh,some of the newspaper accounts,this is one that's very interesting that's come out of this.Ah,the Soviets are saying that in order to get us to repeal the amendment,Ah,for instance,Curtis Kayman,who is,uh,Deputy Assistant Secretary of State at that meeting,told the pit gathering that the United States has agreed to accept 50,000 Soviet immigrants in the coming year.And of course,this is one of the areas where the Soviets are saying they're letting down the bars.They're going to let these people out,but one of the stipulations is that they want better trade relations,more trade with America because they need our dollars,as you said.The ruble is totally worthless.

**spk_0:** [20:31.15 - 20:48.83] Well,I hate to tell you this,but it does look like the Bush administration is tending toward lifting the Jackson van.regulations and,and a mere letting of 50,000 people out of the Soviet Union is,is just a little speck on the horizon of what's wrong with human rights in the Soviet bloc.

**spk_2:** [20:48.99 - 21:15.45] That's right.Well,we seem to be grabbing,and of course these meetings verified this,we seem to be grabbing at any type of opening that can allow us to pour more and more.Billions and you know,into the Soviet Union and but as I said,for so many of these meetings,the whole thrust was doing away with the Jackson Vanek Amendment.So this is one of the biggest things the Soviets were pushing.All right,

**spk_0:** [21:15.51 - 21:28.11] now another thing they're pushing is this peace offensive to make Americans believe that we don't need any national defense,any military weapons anymore,because the Soviets are peace loving and obviously wouldn't use any weapons.If they had them.

**spk_2:** [21:28.44 - 21:57.27] Phyllis,this is another thrust of the media that so many of these people were presented,for instance,they were taken to a local mall where they were given,um,a gift certificate to buy,you know,clothes,jeans,whatever at Penney's.Ah,they were given,you know,free lunches.It was actually something that probably the,the Soviets would never forget because they were just wined and dined.Um,they were,you know,cast into the spotlight.I think that even,

**spk_0:** [21:57.34 - 22:02.59] well,I don't mind the Russians being wined and dined,but I'm worried about the effect on Americans.Well,this is it.

**spk_2:** [22:03.06 - 22:31.68] The whole gist of it was that,uh,look,Americans,these people are just like you and.Look,they love the shopping centers.They were just wild about our food.They're people just like you and I.We know that.We know that it's the leadership Phy that are,uh,the,the ones that are in command that really call the tune,and these people were really,um,Set forth into one of our inner cities,Pittsburgh,and presented as just people,just exactly as well,

**spk_0:** [22:32.00 - 22:44.56] they are people,that's true,but it is the men in the Kremlin who are running the show and the people in the street who may be just like you and me have nothing whatever to say about the policies of the Kremlin.And so

**spk_2:** [22:44.56 - 23:02.22] it's one thing that should be brought out too that I think we haven't gotten into yet.Those that did attend this meeting from the Soviet Union were actually handpicked by the Soviets.Oh,of course,and this is the one thing that so many Americans don't understand,and I'm

**spk_0:** [23:02.22 - 23:29.26] sure they were handpicked to be good,good,articulate representatives of the of what the Russians wanted us to hear.Well,Marjorie,we're out of time.I.I appreciate very much your being with us today.We've been talking with Marjorie Provin of Pittsburgh who attended the recent meeting called Chautauqua at Pitt,uh,with which we had discussions and dialogues between the Russians and Americans.And you

**spk_1:** [23:29.26 - 23:41.20] know what,it was in 1985,I believe,Phyllis,the US and Soviet agreement on education came about and Uh,you are an expert on that matter,and we're,

**spk_0:** [23:41.75 - 24:09.26] we've got another expert on that who's on the line,uh,from Maine.Charlotte,Charlotte Izerbeid,are you there?Well,Marjorie Provin's been telling us about the recent Russian-American meeting at the University of Pittsburgh,and she referred to the,uh,the agreement that was signed,uh,in 1985 in Geneva,uh,as kind of a precursor of what was going on in Pittsburgh.Would you bring our listeners up to date,uh,on that agreement?

**spk_6:** [24:09.82 - 25:23.71] Well,the agreement,uh,very simply,uh,in an official document states that.Um,the parties to the agreement which were signed in Geneva,the agreement will encourage the conclusion,ah,of agreements on cooperation in the field of science and technology and also additional agreements in other specific fields including the humanities and social sciences,and then it goes on,it commits the United States and the Soviets to the facilitation of the exchange,and I think that's very important because that's what you're looking at in Pittsburgh.Uh,by appropriate,uh,organizations of educational and teaching materials including textbooks,syllabi,and curriculum materials on methodology,samples of teaching instruments,and audio visual aids,and then you go,it goes on,and encourages the exchange of primary and secondary school textbooks,teaching materials,and conducting of joint studies on textbooks.And of course all of this calls for the kind of exchange that you,you had between professors and people in every field,I gather at the Chautauqua Institute.Meeting at the University of Pittsburgh.

**spk_0:** [25:23.89 - 25:36.58] Well,just so we understand you,you're saying that this Geneva agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union called for us to cooperate with the Russians on textbooks,visual aids,curricula,and what goes on in the public schools.

**spk_6:** [25:36.74 - 25:52.85] Oh,absolutely,yes,cooperate in the development of the curricula.And the interesting thing I find here,uh,Phyllis,is that federal.Prohibits the United States Department of Education from developing curricula for our local schools,but evidently

**spk_0:** [25:52.85 - 25:56.21] that's because we believe in local control of education.That's right.

**spk_6:** [25:56.32 - 26:07.65] But the federal law doesn't seem to apply to Soviet educators.They're allowed to develop curriculum for our local schools.It's just incredible.I mean it is.I mean nobody could possibly call it anything other than that.

**spk_0:** [26:08.19 - 26:17.86] And what do you see as the as the chief detriment to our country from this type of exchange of Russians and Americans that we had at the University of Pittsburgh?

**spk_6:** [26:18.25 - 27:10.92] Well,I think that the Soviet citizens or professors or whatever who will come over are very carefully selected,and nobody's allowed out of the country that isn't going to benefit their Marxist Leninist system.And Americans seem to feel that they can come and go as we come and go.Even young students who are coming over on exchanges are usually.The children of party projects,whatever you call them,they're,they're children of party officials,and they have been very heavily indoctrinated since age 3 in Marxist Leninism,and that is continuing.Phyllis,people may think that with perestroika they're going to do away with that,but I have official documents out of the Soviet Union,just recent documents saying that they're going to emphasize.Leninist theory.These,

**spk_0:** [27:11.06 - 27:33.19] these people who were sent over are very carefully trained that when Americans talk about what's wrong in the Soviet Union,they dismiss that quickly and move very fast into talking about some type of similar problem in the United States,and that feeds what Jean Kirkpatrick has called the myth of equivalency that 11 country's just as bad as the other.

**spk_6:** [27:33.51 - 28:30.10] Well,that's true,and a friend of mine sent me an extraordinary.Issue of the Washington Post.Everybody out there should get it if they can.It's,uh,Sunday,October 8th,and,uh,it's,it's,uh,it's called Is perestroika a Soviet Version of the New Deal.And this article is taken from a speech given by Edward Shevard Nazi,the foreign minister of the Soviet Union,and it was adapted from the prepared English text of a speech he gave.The Foreign Policy Association in New York and you're exactly that.In fact,he's saying that the problems that they're having now in the Soviet Union are the same as the problems we had during the Great Depression,and he's making all sorts of excuses for Soviet behavior,and it's a very,very important issue of The Washington Post for people to understand that what they Talking about.Well,

**spk_0:** [28:30.22 - 28:37.42] thank you very much,Charlotte.We're out of time.We appreciate your alerting us to this communist propaganda and there's more

**spk_1:** [28:37.42 - 28:49.40] to come on this subject of our students being introduced to false and political cultural issues on the USA Radio Network.We will return with Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_7:** [28:53.51 - 29:54.58] Phonics.You've heard that phonics is the best proven method for teaching children to read.You've also heard that most schools have abandoned phonics or combined it with the less effective look,say,or whole language methods to help combat this problem.Eagle Forum's president Phyllis Schlaffly,who taught her six children to read before she sent them to school,selected a program to help you teach your children to read at home.Eagle Forum's Head Start reading course is an intensive phonics reading program especially recommended for six year olds.Each set comes with a child's workbook,a teacher's book,and a McGuffey reader.Write Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002 and request information on the Head Start reading course today.Give your children a head start for life.Teach them how to read.Contact Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [29:57.77 - 30:17.84] On the USA Radio Network.Welcome back to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.We're not taking your calls today.Now we've heard from a couple of fascinating guests on Russians coming to US colleges and indoctrinating our students with a lot of false impressions.Phyllis,why don't you introduce us to our next expert on this whole topic?

**spk_0:** [30:17.98 - 31:38.88] Our next guest.Is Doctor Robert Morris of New Jersey.He is the new chairman of America's Future,a long time educational institution and foundation that I've been,uh,proud to know about for many,many years.He has a very distinguished career.He's been a university president.He was past president of the University of Dallas and of the University of Plano.Uh,some time ago he was chief counsel to the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee.He's the author of many books and,uh,probably one of the great authorities,uh,in the United States on the,the communist and Soviet apparatus and,uh,with the problems that has posed,uh.To the United States.Doctor Morris,are you there?I'm here,fellas.Well,we're very happy that you were able to join us today.We heard in the earlier part of the program from a reporter who attended this US Russian uh exchange at the University of Pittsburgh called Chautauqua at Pitt.And we saw how the Russians are sent over to spread their new line under glasnost and perestroika,and we also heard reference to the USSSR agreement in Geneva in 19 1985 that caused these exchanges,and I understand in America's future you're going to be publishing a pamphlet on this.

**spk_8:** [31:39.02 - 31:58.05] Yes,we are,Phyllis.It's a very,very serious development,you see.It's It's only really beginning now,but it's beginning to mushroom,and it's going to fit in very correctly with President Bush's plan to integrate the Soviet Union into the Western councils of the world.

**spk_0:** [31:58.56 - 32:16.96] Well,we're particularly concerned with the impact it's going to have on education,both the public schools and as we've been talking today at the university level.It really does give the Russians the opportunity to influence curriculum,textbooks,and ideas that are discussed.

**spk_8:** [32:17.22 - 33:25.83] See,let's be fundamental about it.In the first place,shaping education is never the role of the federal government.Nowhere does the power granted to the federal government to control curriculum and classroom education.Uh,not only that,there's a prohibition against it.I think,as you have pointed out.Uh,the,uh,We have a a a a report here from the General Educational Provisions Act that covers all US Department of Education activities.Now that prohibits the federal government from exercising any direction,supervision,or control over the curriculum,program of instruction,administration of personnel of any educational institution,school,or school system,or.The selection of library resources,textbooks,or rather printed or published instrumental material by any educational institution or school system.In other words,are we doing that,not only the federal government doing it,but it's doing it in conjunction with,in cooperation with the USSR,the Soviet Union,which from all everything you read in the press these days is now a discredited ideological force.

**spk_0:** [33:26.41 - 33:42.14] I suppose the theory was that when it comes to education in contrast to every other type of federal spending,um,the theory was that we could spend federal money on education,but the control would not follow.And as we see,control usually follows the money.

**spk_8:** [33:42.68 - 33:50.04] Not only that,Phyllis,but the Soviets are superb.propagandists and spreaders of disinformation.Well,

**spk_0:** [33:50.15 - 34:04.08] give us some examples of what you think are the main pieces of disinformation and propaganda that the Russians are spreading.I think we,they're not trying to turn American students into communists,but what are they selling?Well,

**spk_8:** [34:04.19 - 34:38.40] what they're doing is,for instance,and they exercise it time and time again,if any of the information,any of the programs we send to the Soviet Union in any way derogatory of the Soviet system.Uh,they insist that this be deleted.For instance,in one case,they,uh,they complained that the United States material was not giving the Soviets enough credit for their,for the,for their role in World War II.And there are things like that all the time,and they always say what a big improvement the Soviet Union structure of government is over the structure of the Tsar.

**spk_0:** [34:38.68 - 35:08.05] There's been some kind of a commission that's been working for a number of years on examining and comparing American and Russian textbooks.Do you know about that?They uh they go over the textbooks just like you say,and they,they say that we're not giving the Soviets enough credit for the good things or that we're overplaying the bad things and then of course they're entitled to their opinion,but then we.Find that there are changes made in American textbooks to comply with the Russian complaint.

**spk_8:** [35:08.18 - 35:18.39] Precisely.That's exactly what they're doing,Phyllis,and,and they in the meantime can can say derogatory things about capitalism and governance of our system of government over here.

**spk_0:** [35:19.14 - 35:24.91] Well,do you see a lot more of these student exchanges coming down the pike in the future?

**spk_8:** [35:25.29 - 35:49.74] It's mushrooming,Phyllis.For instance,Howard Phillips.As a has put out a paper showing just some,some scope of this whole thing.For instance,the American Council of Teachers of Russian,they got a grant of $95,000.The Council for International Educational Exchange,$25,000.Informational Research and Exchange Board,$765,000.

**spk_0:** [35:49.85 - 35:51.63] Is this taxpayers' money?Yes,

**spk_8:** [35:51.81 - 35:56.32] taxpayers' money.These are,these are funded for the most part by the

**spk_0:** [35:59.32 - 36:02.02] Does it,does it come under the USIA,

**spk_8:** [36:02.75 - 36:04.32] United States,the USIA,right,

**spk_0:** [36:04.70 - 36:27.28] uh-huh.And I suppose the purpose into the millions is,is to sell American students on the idea that the Russian people are just like us and they are peace loving and their problems are comparable to our problems.And they don't tell them about the Soviet missile force.They certainly don't tell them about the economic disaster of the Soviet Union,

**spk_8:** [36:27.62 - 38:51.11] right?For instance,the Joint Committee on Soviet Studies,they got a grant of 775,000.And as I say,this is only the very beginning of this whole thing.I think as you pointed out,the Soviets are well aware of the potential of this thing.The,uh,they have a,there's a quote here from the,uh,the Soviet cultural minister who says that this is just the beginning.Uh,this is going to grow and expand and to use his words,um.The Soviets know exactly what they are doing.Vladimir Grenkov,chief of the foreign relations section of the Soviet Ministry of Culture,said,these are just the first little birds,as we say in Russian,and I hope that after these we'll follow entire flocks.Now this has to be analyzed in the context of the whole framework of our relations now between the Soviet Union and the United States.George Bush is now going to meet with Mikhail Gorbachev at Malta,and he's going to pursue the overall theory of our trying to integrate the word he used,Soviet culture and Soviet activities into the American,into the Western Council of Nations.And now,if this is done in the present framework,and I think people don't understand the present framework.Gorbachev's new thinking,which he calls perestroika,is designed completely in the first place.It,it,it admits uh improvements in granting freedom to the countries of Eastern Europe,but at the same time,to use their words,it's supposed to enhance the military capacity and improve the combat readiness of the Soviet army.And also,and this is the most important thing,to to encourage.On our part,a spirit of disarmament,and certainly we're doing that and that's not only their stated purposes,but as you know,every United States defense report,Gaines Weekly,and all these think tanks are always showing that the Soviets are greatly improving and greatly widening their tremendous lead over us.Meanwhile,we're disarming and if this thing goes on for another year,if we do have this interdependence or Merger between the two nations,which this is only a part of,will be a very minor partner member of that partnership.

**spk_0:** [38:51.63 - 39:00.70] Secretary of Defense Cheney has said that the Soviets have not reduced their spending or their modernization of their military force one iota.

**spk_8:** [39:01.09 - 39:20.22] I bet the last figure was that they're they're increasing theirs by 3% while before we began went onto this disarmament binge,we were,we were decreasing ours by 11%.Now listening to the latest report of Secretary of Defense Cheney,this thing is now mushroom.I'm sure it's much more than 11% now.

**spk_0:** [39:20.49 - 39:27.78] Well,when we come back after a break,I want to ask you what you.I think is the significance of glasnost and what it really means for us.

**spk_1:** [39:28.01 - 39:46.09] Obviously,Dr.Morris has a lot of substance to add to this topic of Soviet US student exchanges,and we'll devote our next segment to Dr.Morris.So stay with us.There's more to come on the USA Radio Network's presentation of Billy Shchlafly Live.

**spk_7:** [40:00.02 - 40:59.90] Are you a homeschooler wondering how to teach American history and the US Constitution?Does your child's teacher need support in the area of private enterprise and US government?Eagle Forum's videos are one good way to help.The American Inventors video discusses how economic freedom combined with the US patent system enabled inventors to create products that have changed the way people live all over the world.We the People,a video endorsed by the Commission on the Bicentennial of the US Constitution,explains the uniqueness of our great Constitution.And how the founding fathers created a document that has outlasted all other governing documents in the world.Order either video We the People or American Inventors for 21.95 each and enrich the education of your children.Write Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.

**spk_9:** [41:00.34 - 41:58.50] Too many children have been cheated out of the education they deserve.Did you know that nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper?Let alone books of history,literature,or science.That's a problem we can no longer afford to ignore.Educational excellence in the public school starts with respect for the rights of students,parents,and taxpayers.But what are they?Every student has the right to be taught to read the English language in the first grade.Every student has the right to family privacy,the right to his religious faith and beliefs,the right to share information with his parents.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy from Eagle-Forum.Learn more about the rights you and your children should expect.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy by writing Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [41:59.45 - 42:07.86] American students are getting a false impression about the Soviet system.Seems to be happening,and we're talking about it on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [42:08.10 - 42:30.67] We've been talking with Doctor Robert Morris,who's the chairman of an educational foundation called America's Future and a long.Time student of the Soviet Union,uh,tell us what you think about glasnost and what it means for us and,uh,what do you think about Gorbachev,uh,letting all these demonstrations go on in Eastern Europe without sending the Soviet tanks in.

**spk_8:** [42:32.62 - 42:36.08] The term new thinking.That's the term that Gorbachev uses all the time.

**spk_0:** [42:36.26 - 42:39.18] Oh,that's a very trendy word in the schools too,very trendy.

**spk_8:** [42:39.22 - 44:13.76] And not only that,but it shows that he is engineering all of this.This is not a spontaneous uprising from the people in Eastern Europe.They felt this way all along,but they could never be allowed to do it.So he's allowing one country after another sequentially to have their say,and then he's coming up with a solution.That whereby he can holds on to control.Take Poland,for instance,I use this as an example.Poland is not a non-communist nation,as every newspaper reports now.Its president at any time can abolish the cabinet,can do abrogate the,the agreement that set up the the uh uh cabinet.They,they agreed to stay within the Warsaw Pact.They have conceded 65% of the of the 65% of the parliament of the communists.Uh,they have 40,000 Soviet troops still in Poland.And in the meantime,they hold a defense portfolio.They have the,uh,secret police,interior police portfolio,and they have the foreign trade portfolio.The only thing that is given to the opposition,solidarity.Is the right to go out and raise money,solving that problem for us,and the whole thing is working perfectly.Uh,Poland is tightly within the Soviet orbit.It stays there.It's controlled by the Soviets and all that we're going through with this agreement,which is only going to supply.Going to raise funds for a very raise money for a communist state controlled by the Soviets.

**spk_0:** [44:13.99 - 44:25.69] Yes,don't,don't you think,or do you think that this is a device to get the American taxpayers and American businessmen to pour money into the bad socialist system in Poland?

**spk_8:** [44:25.83 - 44:49.98] Of course it is,Phyllis.We're spending billions already.Coal,I see,is spending,sending $2.2 billion into Poland.Last week,the United States Congress passed a bill authorizing something like 700 million to a lesser,and they're individual grants.This thing is mushrooming.It's solving the Soviet problem of how to finance and support

**spk_0:** [44:50.32 - 44:52.00] their the communist system,

**spk_8:** [44:52.27 - 45:00.64] the communist system or a communist controlled state.Now they are giving,they're opening it up a bit and they're giving more freedom to the individuals.And,and well,

**spk_0:** [45:00.68 - 45:10.71] they're letting them demonstrate in the streets,but don't you think in the Soviet Union they had a lot of changes of people,but it was a great way for Gorbachev to get rid of his enemies.

**spk_8:** [45:10.84 - 45:47.49] Of course.And who are these people coming in?And you notice when they did remove the Berlin Wall and made openings in the Berlin Wall of the something like several million taking visas to come in,or less than 3,less than 3 or 4% remained.They all went back again.Uh,so they didn't rush for freedom.They went back to where they are.The ones who were really opponents of,of,of Gorbachev and really understood what was going on,they stayed,but the others went back because they had to go to their,their regular duties and they had to carry on the work of the sustain their families.

**spk_0:** [45:47.89 - 46:07.55] Well,they're not going to have a rising standard of living in those countries unless they have freedom because communism and socialism always produce poverty.And I think it'd be a terrible mistake for us to bail out their economic disaster and pour money into their controlled socialist economy.Precisely,

**spk_8:** [46:07.80 - 46:38.95] precisely.We're going to finance the The Soviet system,Marxism and Leninism with some exceptions,and openings,and trappings of of free enterprise and market economy.We did the same thing when we dealt with communist China for the last 4 or 5 years.The Same kind of thing took place over there.There were openings.There were.vestiges of free enterprise over there,but actually what happened was we were only strengthening them and then when their control was threatened,they showed they showed their fangs.

**spk_0:** [46:39.19 - 47:11.33] But as we watch the effect that the nightly news has on young people who don't remember the past,it appears that they think that because Gorbachev is not sending the tanks in to mow people down in the.Streets as they did in,in '68 and 56 in Tiananmen Square,uh,that therefore everything's changed.He's a good guy.Uh,he's peace loving now and now Russia can join the family of nations,uh,come into the World Bank and uh get all kinds of money and credits from the United States.

**spk_8:** [47:11.77 - 47:24.78] He gets an 85,84% favorable rating in West Germany.And any kind of a reunification or merger between the two Germany will result in a composite that may well be against us.

**spk_0:** [47:25.60 - 47:35.64] Well,we do thank you for your publications that you put out by America's Future.Have you got a title yet for the one that you're going to be doing on the US USSR exchanges?I haven't given the label

**spk_8:** [47:35.64 - 47:53.14] yet,but it's Charlotte's Charlotte is a bit.Pamphlet on America's future,which is 514 Main Street,uh,New Rochelle,New York,10801.And it'll be out I imagine in about a month.

**spk_0:** [47:53.38 - 48:33.83] All right,well,if you'll provide some copies to us,we'll make them available to our listeners,and it's a very fine thing you're doing,uh,publishing Charlotte Izerby's paper on that.She did the original research about that agreement in 1985.Uh,I know I was over there in Geneva at the time,and the big news was all about.Whether Reagan was going to give in on SDI,uh,and he didn't,but apparently in the back room somewhere they signed this education agreement which is going to have a big impact on the development of curriculum in the public schools,and I think Americans are horrified,uh,to think that the Russians are going to have anything to say about what we learn in the schools.

**spk_8:** [48:34.42 - 48:45.79] See,people don't understand this,Phyllis,and you and,and,and Charlotte are doing a great job and and bringing all these things out.But if the American people understand what,what the real essence of this thing is.They will recoil in horror.

**spk_0:** [48:46.37 - 49:03.15] Well,we certainly do thank Doctor Robert Morris,chairman of America's Future,for talking with us today.He's the author of many books.Uh,he does a newspaper column.He's been writing for years on this subject,and there's no greater authority on this subject.Thank you for joining us.Thank you for having me,Phyllis.

**spk_1:** [49:03.61 - 49:26.01] We've,uh,pretty much covered the.Gamut on the Russians at US colleges.Met a few interesting guests for some insight.Phyllis,we'll need a summary of your feelings,of course,and we'll do it on the USA Radio Network,the weekly program putting you at the forefront of what's really happening in the education system.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.
