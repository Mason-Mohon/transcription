**spk_1:** [00:32.77 - 00:32.97] right

**spk_0:** [00:32.97 - 00:37.33] here on Bible Teaching Radio AM 1320 KSIB.

**spk_1:** [00:39.12 - 00:49.80] Today Saint Louis gets the first taste of what I feel will be one of America's best live call-in programs,education in America and your rights as a parent.

**spk_0:** [00:52.36 - 01:30.53] Now become informed on how the public schools affect you and your children from an experienced pro-family perspective.KSIV Radio and Eagle-Forum present Phyllis-Schlafly.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live on parents' rights and education.And this is exciting because St.Louis is becoming acquainted with what you just said,what we hope will be one of the best live call-in programs across America,and it's been too long.You know,you've specialized in education for 7 years,and I think this program,as a matter of fact,today's topic,sex education,is going to be a real zinger.

**spk_1:** [01:30.77 - 01:50.68] I'm grateful to KSIV for giving us this preview for the local St.Louis area listeners on this program.Uh,we'll be starting nationally next Saturday at this same time,and I'm very excited to be able to give the KSIV listeners a look at what we're going to be talking about every week at this hour.

**spk_0:** [01:50.93 - 02:06.59] You know what?You've already got a built-in audience.You're heard on your radio commentaries,the Phyllis-Schlafly Report on 250 radio stations.People across the country read your column every day,uh.Well,twice a week and you're in 200 newspapers,

**spk_1:** [02:06.91 - 08:02.67] right?But this is,this program is going to be a live program and that will give parents the opportunity to call in and tell what has been happening in their own public schools to their own children.You know,when parents first become aware of some of the curricula that they find offensive.To their religious values,they are usually told you were the only one who ever complained.What I hope we'll be able to do on this program is to show parents that other people like you,parents and teachers across the country,have encountered these same problems,and then we will be able to counsel you on what to do about it.Now,let me tell you one story about sex education,which I think illustrates a lot of lessons.You remember it was about a year and a half ago that Dr.Koop announced and stated in one of his brochures that we should have explicit sex education in the early elementary grades.Now many of us believe that that is not a good idea because this gets the child during the latency period and it is not helpful to be so explicit in the 4th grade,3rd grade,5th grade,and so forth.So I held a news conference in Washington DC and explained some of my objections to this notion of Doctor Koop and since he's a very important person,the Surgeon General of the United States has got a lot of press.You know how it is with the press when it goes out on the wire services,it's picked up all around the country.Well,during the course of that news conference,one of the reporters very aggressively said,Well,Mrs.Schlafly,you,you are criticizing sex education.Can you name one example?It wasn't Sam Donaldson,was it?Well,I don't think it was Sam,but,but you know how they are.You're talking in generalities about a bad issue.And this reporter said,Well,Mrs.Schlaffling,name one example of one of these bad textbooks on sex education.And I said,Well,uh,one of them has been used for a number of years in the Seattle public schools,and it's called You and Your Health,written by William Fassbender.It has been used in a high school's,uh,health class in Seattle ever since 1978.And then I said,uh,let me tell you some of the things that are in this,uh,textbook in a mandatory health class.Uh,this book,uh,tells the children.That group marriage can be defined as a marriage between 3 or more people and then asks the students,do you think you might be interested in becoming part of such a group?Then the textbook said often promiscuity is labeled as bad by persons who do not accept this type of behavior.As with other patterns of sexual behavior,one should not pin a good or bad label on a practice.Now you can imagine the child who comes from a good religious home where they teach that promiscuity is bad.Now reads in the textbook that it is bad to label promiscuity as bad and then I went on further about the textbook.Uh,the textbook told the children that morality is individual it is what you think it is.Now I said that is absolutely contrary to what many of us believe.In other words,many of us believe that God already invented the moral code.It's called the 10 Commandments,and we don't appreciate the school or the textbook telling this kid in the 5th grade that he can invent his own moral code.We don't want him to do that.There already is a moral code,and it's up to him to learn what it is.Uh,this textbook also said it has been suggested by some marriage counseling authorities that all couples should live together before they are married.Now these are very offensive,and it went on to legitimize not only promiscuity but homosexuality and even said it was OK to be a peeping Tom.Well,uh,I had talked about this,uh,book in a number of places,but at this particular news conference where I was criticizing,uh,Everett Koop,it went out on the wire services,and then it was printed on the front page of the Seattle paper because that's the way the news media pick up stories.Uh,that kind of hit the fan in Seattle,and the next day the school board called the parent who had been complaining about this book for 18 months and said,Why don't you come down and we'll talk this over.And uh her name was Sally Bostad and she was very stunned to hear this because she'd been trying to bring it to the attention of the school authorities over many months,but she was a very smart parent.So when she arrived at the appointed place uh to meet with the curriculum committee of the Seattle school board.Uh,she came with Xerox copies of a lot of the offensive pages out of the book for distribution,and she came with the local TV cameras and the local reporters whom she had alerted,which was perfectly proper for her to do because anybody who's spending the taxpayers' money like school boards should have open meetings.Well,it was very interesting to see what happened.The press quoted from the book and people were horrified.At that point,the members of the school board and the curriculum committee said they didn't know how the book got in the school and nobody was willing to take responsibility for it.

**spk_0:** [08:02.83 - 08:06.78] Who has to approve a textbook before it goes into a school district?

**spk_1:** [08:06.87 - 09:04.78] Well,the curriculum committee and the people on the school board,but it's not the teachers,you know,the teachers don't select the school books at all.They are put in their hands.And all of a sudden they found money to buy copies of a substitute text,which they had denied up till this point that they had in the school budget.So it was a great victory for these parents.It took a long time.Uh,but I think it shows how important it is to expose what's going on in the textbooks,and we do urge the parents to read what is in their school textbooks,uh,which certainly should be available to any parent.And it's quite a lesson of how you can find out what's going on in the classes,what is in the books,and how,what parents can do about it by bringing it to public attention.

**spk_0:** [09:05.41 - 09:43.73] That's what we intend to do with this program,Phyllis-Schlafly Live on parents' rights and education,and we're looking forward to getting phone calls from all across America.But as we did mention,we're doing just a local broadcast so that the engineering staff and myself,I'm Bruce Horlick,that we can get acquainted.With our surroundings for the network linking up next week.You know what,we've been promoting it during the week and we're already starting to get calls at 961-1320.And if you want to jump in on the conversation,you're welcome to do so.961-1320.Let's take a telephone call now.Elaine in St.Louis,hello there.

**spk_1:** [09:47.30 - 13:44.65] It's wonderful.Thank you for calling in.Do you have a comment or question?Yes,I guess,uh,both.Uh,first of all,I want to preface my question with saying that I served on the Saint Louis task force on teen pregnancy for about a year,and it was very frustrating.Uh,you know,it's,it's so typical.They gave lip service to the benefits of abstinence from sex,but like a typical bureaucratic organization,we spent a lot of time and was it,was it set up by the city?Yes.It was a city agency that set it up and,uh,I was one of the members of that committee,and they were decent people,uh,but it just seems as though we spent all this time and money and all we seemed to come up with was low self-esteem.They just didn't develop as is,I think,typical of any policymaking outfit today.They don't deal with the health hazards and illegal nature of premature sex.All we heard was self-esteem.And it just seems as though we've had sex education and these experts tell us for over 20 years the same old stuff and it hasn't worked.Uh,they just failed to come up with the sensible,healthful,legal solutions like abstinence from sex at a young age.In fact,I just would say this,they,they try to portray portray parents and other people who oppose sex education as people who look for babies under cabbage leaves.Like there was a recent Riverfront Times article that uh was entitled If You Don't Stop It,You'll Go Blind,and the,um,the suggestion was that that those of us who oppose.by,uh,youngsters that something like,uh,going blind.Happen,you know,it's all this finding the babies under cabbage and these ideas.We are not backward people.We are trying to do what's sensible,helpful,and legal for the children.So when you,when you told them that they ought to be teaching something healthy like abstinence until marriage,what kind of reaction did you get?Were most of the people on this task force social service professionals or who were they?And what,what did they answer to the abstinence argument?Most of them were.Professionals were in some form in some aspect of social work.They paid lip service to abstinence.They all agreed that that was,that was ideal.Yes,but I found that nobody wants to argue against abstinence anymore.But they,they go on to put that down in a little corner and say,well,that might be all right for some people,but of course for most of them we need to talk about giving them contraceptives.Is that what they did?Yes,and in fact they People talk about how they deal with it.From a school-based clinic talk about how they dispense prescriptions for contraceptives,and they don't seem to think that there's anything wrong with that.It's like everybody's doing it,so this is what we have to do.We have to supply the means to keep them from getting pregnant,but isn't that based on the notion that all these children are engaging in sexual activity anyway?And,and they're not all doing it,are they?No.And,and it doesn't give any encouragement to those kids that are trying to hold the line.It to me it's like if you have a successful business,uh,and you have failed businesses,you don't go to the failures to find out how you can make your business better.You go to the successful businessman or business person to find out how to make your business go.And the same way with these kids,I think.I think we should look to the successes,and as I see it,the successes are the kids who do not get all wrapped up in sexual activity before marriage.And that I,I don't want to take too much of your time,but it brings me to one more crucial point as far as the bureaucratic,uh,A perspective on this,

**spk_0:** [13:45.13 - 14:07.21] and Elaine,we're going to get to that when we come back.A most enlightening telephone call and eye opening.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live this week from St.Louis over at KSIV.Our telephone number is 961-1320.For our friends on the Illinois side,feel free to join us.Area code 314-961-1320.

**spk_1:** [17:12.54 - 18:42.12] and Elaine,we have to go on to another caller,but just to wrap up,uh,because of your experience on this task force on teen pregnancy,do you think that the youngsters are hungry for guidance about what is healthy?Are they ready for discipline?And idealism,or do you think they need to just have a little handholding in their promiscuous behavior?Absolutely.I think they're hungry for discipline,guidance.I think they see that this isn't working for them,it's causing all kinds of problems,and I can't understand why.Maybe you can shed some light on this,Phyllis.Why do these bureaucratic departments and agencies?Refused to try these methods.I,I don't know if you heard me before.I may,I may have been,um,disconnected by then,um,about the state of Missouri Department of Health with their video.Did that come across on that?OK.I just wanted to add that,that with big,uh,hoopla,they announced at a news conference this new video on the problem of teen pregnancy,and when they showed us the video,it was,um,The Message was,I will wait for sex till I'm ready,and I posed the question,why can't this video say I will wait for sex till marriage?I think they confuse the kids with these kind of terms.And what's so awful about telling kids to wait till they're married to have sex?Well,it's a healthy as well as the right thing to do.So thank you very much,Elaine.I think we'll move on to the next caller.

**spk_0:** [18:42.20 - 18:49.10] It's LaDonna in South St.Louis.Hi,LaDonna.You're on the air with Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Go right ahead.

**spk_1:** [18:49.22 - 19:17.53] Oh,hello.Um,I had a question.Uh,my only child is in college,so you know this is all academic for me now,but the stuff I've been reading about lately is just so outrageous.Um,I thought it would be illegal,and if a derelict sat down at a bus stop next to a young child and said these things,there would be criminal charges,so.I wondered if anyone had ever thought about doing that,and I'll hang up because I can't hear the radio over the phone,and I'd like an answer to this.Thank you.Thank you

**spk_0:** [19:17.53 - 19:18.85] for the telephone call,Phyllis.Come.

**spk_1:** [19:19.17 - 20:37.25] I guess you're saying that things are said to children in the classroom and in the textbooks which if some derelict on the street said he would be prosecuted.And indeed there is a lot of truth to what you say.Even some of the language that is used in these sex education courses is highly offensive.Some people have called some of the sex education courses pornographic.We have many instances that have come to our Eagle-Forum.Forum Parent Advisory Center of where the children were deliberately told to use the gutter language terms for acts and body parts,words that we couldn't possibly say on this radio program,but they are taught to be familiar with them in the classroom.And it's a very,very serious situation for lots of parents and students,and we do urge them to,to look into what is being taught.The question was asked earlier of how are textbooks chosen.They're chosen in different ways in different districts,and you should find out which way they are chosen,and then perhaps you can be part of the choosing process.

**spk_0:** [20:37.97 - 20:45.13] You're next.This is Lois on KSIV radio for Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Your question or comment?

**spk_1:** [20:45.57 - 24:34.93] Well,my comment is,um,that I thank P Phyllis for doing this program,and I just wanted to let her know that,uh,we are working fast and furiously with respect in uh.This general area in Saint Louis and Missouri and in Illinois.OK,Sex Respect is a program that teaches abstinence before marriage.It's a 10 lesson plan that can be taught in science or in health or in home ec,uh,at the junior high school level.It has been very effectively done.We've done attitude surveys before and after the curriculum has been taught in pilot schools,and we're showing dramatic,uh,changes in young teenagers' attitudes about whether or not they should have sex before marriage,uh,whether or not a pregnancy results.They're beginning to see the emotional damage that is done to young people.Um,well,how do you answer the argument,uh,Lois,that you,that you're just imposing your religious values on public school children?Isn't that what's often thrown out that's exactly what's thrown out,and we do not debate the argument on morality at all.We're debate it on scientific and health grounds that young people,um.Suffer besides teen pregnancy.They suffer sexually transmitted diseases and they suffer,uh,teen suicides are a perfect,um,Uh,ultimate result of what's happening with kids who are involved in sexual relationships.In other words,you don't tell them,uh,what is morally right or wrong.You just tell them what is healthy and unhealthy.Is that what you're saying?That's exactly what we're saying.And the kids are so hungry for this information.We have one school district in the western part of the state in Lamar.That,uh,has been taught now for 2 years by a school nurse and she has no teen pregnancies and the kids are just ecstatic over this,this program as they are in all of the the schools where it's being taught.We don't have one parental complaint.Um,the administrations are happy with the program.Uh,we're just really excited that we're able to respond to the problems.Isn't this program funded under Title 20,which was put into the federal law on the sponsorship of former Senator Jeremiah Denton?Yes,that is.It's been in effect since 1982,Phyllis,and I'm glad you brought that up.I hope that you're going to tell.We're about to lose that.Well,you know,maybe you do know that Senator Ted Kennedy has a bill in the in the Congress right now which is called Number S-120,I believe,and what it is is to throw out or disallow the courses.Teach only abstinence and to make it mandatory that everything that gets any federal dollars teaches what they call comprehensive sex education,which includes contraceptives and abortion referrals.That's exactly what I understand is happening,and I hope that everybody in the listening audience will contact both,uh,the senators in,uh,Missouri and in Illinois and ask them to vote against that because,uh,I don't think even though we think we have very fine senators here in Missouri that we necessarily have their vote.Um,I've been in contact and Well,you should tell them,uh,how effective,uh,your,uh,your health course has been.How many schools in Missouri are you using it in?Actually,Phyllis,we're doing it in,uh,4 pilot schools,but there are many other schools that are using it that are not part of the pilot program.Riverview Gardens,for example,is using it very successfully,and I wasn't even aware they were using it.So there are schools,uh,in.that are using it without the testing procedure that we're using in the pilot program.

**spk_4:** [24:35.13 - 24:35.61] Thank you for the

**spk_0:** [24:35.61 - 24:40.05] telephone call,Phyllis.Are you familiar with Josh McDonald's series Why Wait?

**spk_1:** [24:40.29 - 24:43.57] I've heard about it,yes,but I haven't seen it.I know it's a very fine program.It's an

**spk_0:** [24:43.57 - 24:51.53] excellent special that KSIV aired last year on all the reasons why.Teen should wait for marriage

**spk_1:** [24:51.53 - 24:52.52] to have sex.

**spk_0:** [24:52.95 - 25:01.48] Oh,it was an excellent program,and we move on to Madeleine waiting in Belleville,Illinois.It's 618-961-1320.Your question or comment?

**spk_1:** [25:01.85 - 27:28.24] Uh,Phyllis,would you please expand on the dangers of sex education programs during the child's latency period?I hear that focusing on sex during this time period can do much permanent irreversible harm to the child.Uh,Doctor Melvin Anchell has done a great deal of work on that.He is a very noted.An educator in these areas and child psychiatrist and and he is told that nature has a wonderful way of putting a child through different stages,you know,when they're about 2 years old,how children like to run around without any clothes on,and that's perfectly normal and then they go into this latency period.When they should not be disturbed by talk about sex,and then of course as we know when they get to be adolescents then they begin to have an awakening and need to have the right type of guidance.In a recent publication put out by the Undersecretary of Education Linus Wright,he tells Quotes from Dr.Anschel that psychoanalysis has established that the period in a child's life between the ages of 6 and 12 is asexual,that is the period when sensual pleasures are normally repressed,and this is well recognized by psychiatrists and doctors throughout the world,and the child simply should not be.Disturbed in that period.That's a time of the child's life when he ought to be learning how to study,learning to appreciate the some facts about history,learning math and and developing himself physically,and he just should not be disturbed.That's why we felt it was so absolutely wrong when Dr.Kop came along.And said that explicit sex ed should be given in the early elementary grades.Incidentally,I might point out that this,uh,information that I just referred to,uh,is available in a packet that we will be able to send you from Eagle-Forum.Uh,it's a very excellent article by the Undersecretary of Education Linus Wright on what parents can do in regard to sex education courses.We have a whole packet on sex education with important.And articles which is available from Eagle-Forum for a donation of $10 and it's

**spk_1:** [33:54.17 - 33:56.10] You know what's important about this time?

**spk_0:** [33:56.31 - 33:56.95] What's important?

**spk_1:** [33:57.06 - 34:08.99] Well,this was the time slot that President Reagan had for so many years,and of course he's not doing his radio program anymore.So I hope we can pick up some of his listeners for our live radio program.

**spk_0:** [34:09.23 - 34:19.48] That's not bad company,I'll tell you that.Well,let's move on to some more phone calls because They're coming in here,uh,very heavy,and we move on to Blanche.Hello there.Your question or comment,please.Yes,before I

**spk_1:** [34:19.48 - 34:47.95] ask my question,excuse me,I'd just like to ask Mr.Schlany,is this the,are these the only kinds of topics program is going to deal with from now on?Most of the programs will deal with the whole subject of education.I,I can tell you it's not all going to be on sex education.There are all kinds of other aspects of education.We're very.Concerned about literacy,about reading,we're very concerned about what kind of drug education is in the schools and all the aspects that have to do with education.

**spk_0:** [34:49.66 - 34:52.68] This has really been your specialty for 7 years now,uh,Phyllis,

**spk_1:** [34:52.93 - 38:06.56] I'm not.I just wanted to ask another question.Sure,go ahead.It seems though whenever they talk about these things like sex education,and I've come to the conclusion that maybe there's some form of sex education is needed.But,uh,they seem more interested in disconnecting the youngsters' reproductive capacities,divorcing childbearing from the idea of sex.Am I imagining it?No,I think you're absolutely right,and you ask a very important question.If you took a poll and asked the public,are they in favor of sex education,you would find a high percentage of people say yes.But then the next question is what kind of sex education do you want?Uh,the type that has been very generally in the public schools for the last 20 years is a type that does not give any guidance about morality.It accepts as a given that all the children are going to be sexually active.That's the term they use,and it teaches them how to use contraceptives.And if the contraceptives fail.What's the next step?Well then,they tell you,often tell them that go see about an abortion.But what we favor,at least what I favor,is a program which would teach children how to be healthy and that abstinence is the way to be healthy,and there are lots of reasons to remain abstinent until marriage,of which.Um,pregnancy is,uh,one reason,uh,venereal disease is another,but there is an enormous amount of emotional and psychological trauma that goes along with sexual activity for children.Excuse me,if I may play devil's advocate for a,for a moment,uh,that,and I would personally agree that,uh,you should wait till marriage.This is where you have sex.But what if I don't,using a,like I said,devil's advocate approach,what if I don't want to get married,but I still want to have sex?Well,it's,it's a free country and you can act like that if you want to,but what many of us object to is people who have that attitude coming into the public schools and teaching it to the children of those who believe in God's law.You see,uh,if,if it's a free country and that if you want to give contraceptives to your children or use them yourself,uh,you can.Nobody's stopping you.Nobody's going to come into your home and tell you what to do or not to do.But many people do object to these groups like Planned Parenthood coming into the public schools and training children how to use contraceptives and telling them that the only thing you need to worry about is a live birth and that any sex that you want to have is OK just so long as you don't have a live birth.Planned Parenthood has denied this.Well,Planned Parenthood has been a chief advocate of the contraceptive style of teaching.It's part and parcel of their teaching that they accept as a given that any sexual activity is OK,and they want to facilitate people engaging in sex without having a live birth.That's why they're big promoters of contraceptives,and they

**spk_0:** [38:06.56 - 38:09.72] stand to make money.Off of this type of thing,

**spk_1:** [38:09.84 - 39:08.56] well,we even have a case where some of the contraceptive manufacturers have provided sex education courses uh for the schools.Ortho did that,and,uh,that's a real conflict of interest to come right into the schools and,and peddle a line and have a curriculum,uh,which encourages the children to buy your product.Uh,we really don't understand that.Well,quite honestly,I find some of this hard to believe too.In fact,I personally don't have any children just as yet,but I don't see why anything we personally,I don't see how,how you could,you have any reason to fabricate.Well,well,no,we're not fabricating anything.Uh,we have a great many materials,most of which information comes from the parents and the teachers who have encountered.Um,these types of courses in the classes and often with very unhappy results.So I appreciate your call.I think you asked some very important questions,

**spk_0:** [39:08.57 - 39:13.37] and we move on to Arnold,Missouri.It's Shirley.Hello,you're on the air with Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_1:** [39:13.72 - 41:32.10] Hello,uh,Phyllis,I tuned in late and you may have already discussed this,but I was curious about whether you,whether or not you thought it.It was advisable to teach sex education in schools at all and say a Christian school.I know many of them are using the sex respect program,which of course is an excellent program,but I know many parents feel that it is something that they would rather just deal with in their home.What is your feelings on this?Well,I think parents' rights should be respected,whether they are public schools or private schools.Some of the states have even have opt out programs and and procedures for the public schools.Personally,I think that there is no need to spend all this time in class on what is called sex education.I would feel more comfortable if they didn't have it and if those who want it would go to a special class or deal with it in some other way.I,uh,we do urge the,the sex respect course or the abstinence course,of which there are several in the public schools because we know they're going to teach something.Approximately 30 states,I believe,have mandated sex education courses in the schools,and so we're dealing with the situation that you have to have something.Uh,in the Christian schools that of course can be decided completely by their,their board,whatever it is,and I would feel more comfortable without most of what is being taught because it is,uh,most of it is not necessary,you know,the human race arrived to the 20th century without any sex education courses and as far as explaining the acts,it can all be done in a very short period of time.We referred earlier to the importance of not disturbing the child during the latency period at all,and if you will look into a lot of these courses,they are K through 12.We would prefer that any school which does have a sex education program would make it opt in instead of opt out.In other words,the parent would have to make an affirmative decision that he wants his child to have this course and done in such a way that it does not embarrass or humiliate those whose parents do not want them to take it.

**spk_0:** [41:32.45 - 41:39.82] And 9 different states right now are teaching uh sex education in in K.Is that amazing?

**spk_1:** [41:39.91 - 41:59.47] K is kindergarten for those who are not into the education jargon,they do start,and you have to wonder.They don't teach reading,spelling,arithmetic,science,history,or any other subject for 13 years.You just wonder what is so difficult about sex that it has to be talked about for 13 years in school,

**spk_0:** [41:59.51 - 42:18.47] and a lot of material that you and your family can use if you want a sharp looking packet on sex education.You can write.Eagle-Forum and a $10 donation is suggested.Simply write to Eagle-Forum,Eagle like the American Eagle,Alton,Illinois 62002.

**spk_1:** [42:18.83 - 43:08.34] Let me say that this new packet on sex education is brand new,and it has some very important articles in it about various,various incidents or controversies that have come about in different school districts all over the country.There was a most interesting one in Kenosha,Wisconsin,for example,where after public protest about one of these explicit K through 12 sex education courses,the school board reversed itself throughout the course,packed up all the books,and sent them back to the publisher and demanded a $72,000 refund.So there are lots of articles in our new sex education packet which will show you how you can deal with whatever problem you have in your area and

**spk_0:** [48:19.83 - 48:52.28] And the matter at hand for today is sex education.This is Phyllis-Schlafly live on KSIV,and as you just heard,we're going nationally on the USA Radio Network next week.And if you want to jump in,we do have a couple lines open.We did have to add some more lines for this program because we knew what kind of response we would get when you're on the air here on KSIV 961-1320.It's 961-1320.And if you're calling from Illinois,it's 618 area code,and we move on to Eureka,and it's Bill.Hello there.Hi,

**spk_8:** [48:52.29 - 49:34.42] uh,uh,you know,the comment about the witchcraft in the in the public schools,it's all witchcraft in those places.In First Samuel 15:23.The prophet tells Samuel that rebellion is as a sin of witchcraft.Uh,whenever we're in rebellion,which the public schools are,it's witchcraft.Now they may be getting into the more self-conscious variety,but they teach that God is irrelevant,that what the Bible says is nonsense,and.You know,to worry about sex education when they're blaspheming Christ.is to swallow a camel and swat at it the period

**spk_1:** [49:34.42 - 50:46.94] when sensual pleasures are normally repressed,and this is well recognized by psychiatrists and doctors throughout the world,and the child simply should not be disturbed in that period.That's a time of the child's life when.He ought to be learning how to study,learning to appreciate the some facts about history,learning math and and developing himself physically,and he just should not be disturbed.That's why we felt it was so absolutely wrong when Dr.Kop came along.And said that explicit sex ed should be given in the early elementary grades.Incidentally,I might point out that this,uh,information that I just referred to,uh,is available in a packet that we will be able to send you from Eagle-Forum.It's a very excellent article by the Undersecretary of Education Linus Wright.On what parents can do in regard to sex education courses.We have a whole packet on sex education with important articles which is available from Eagle-Forum for a donation of 10 dollars,
