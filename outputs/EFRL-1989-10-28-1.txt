**spk_0:** [00:01.53 - 00:10.85] Halloween is coming again,but spooks and witches don't just prowl the streets at night.They ride in the public school classroom all during the month of October.

**spk_1:** [00:12.51 - 01:08.61] Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Bruce Hayes here inviting you to join us for the next hour,and we'll be jumping right into your telephone calls.So jot it down 1-800-736-3202.Phyllis,we had so many calls that we couldn't get to when we did a program on witchcraft last month that we've just got to do another one today.Uh,you'll remember that one parent who called in on our program and said he discovered that a 6th grade child had been assigned 20 papers to write on Halloween,and I can remember another parent who called in.And said that she found out that the entire month of October was devoted to Halloween.I mean,stories,lessons,drawings,games,crafts,and other kinds of activities.Well,today we want to hear from more parents about what they found out,what's happening in their public schools regarding Halloween.So give us a call at 1-800-736-3202.

**spk_0:** [01:08.95 - 01:31.27] Bruce,it seems that Halloween is no longer just an extracurricular activity for fun and games after schoolchildren.Done their studies and their homework or just to dress up in costume on one night of the year.Halloween has become a major teaching subject in the public school classroom,so we want to go right to the phone so we can hear firsthand from parents what they've discovered.

**spk_1:** [01:31.39 - 01:36.34] They're already lining up.Let's go to our first caller in East Providence,Rhode Island.Here's Bob.

**spk_0:** [01:36.47 - 01:45.11] Hello Bob.Hi Phyllis.I understand you have had some type of Halloween experience with your children in the schools.How about telling our listeners about it?

**spk_2:** [01:45.34 - 02:49.14] OK.Uh It was in about the 3rd week of September.My wife and I had just moved into the East Providence School District,and we make it a practice of going down and meeting the teachers of our children.We're Christians and we wanted to talk to the teachers and ask if our children could be excused from What normally is a Halloween party on October 31st.So we went down and met with our third grader's teacher.It was about,I think it was September 21st.And asked if our son could be excluded from the Halloween party.Uh,because of our beliefs,we don't believe in it,in the Halloween themes or anything else,and she had kind of a puzzled look on her face and says,well,Uh,he could be excluded from the party,but she thought we ought to know that they utilize the Halloween themes throughout the curriculum for the entire month of October.

**spk_0:** [02:49.95 - 02:53.95] The entire month of October.And did she tell you how she uses it?

**spk_2:** [02:54.35 - 03:16.23] Well,they use it in,uh,their creative writing topics in storytelling,arts and crafts.In fact,the arts and crafts teacher was sitting there with her during our discussion.And uh singing.And of course then there's the decorations around the classroom,the the classroom itself.The decorations were already up.

**spk_0:** [03:16.79 - 03:20.45] And what do the decorations look like?Do they have witches and goblins,

**spk_2:** [03:20.69 - 03:28.73] witches,ghosts,uh,those are the ones I noticed right off,of course,pumpkins with the face on them.And

**spk_0:** [03:28.90 - 03:35.89] well,pumpkins are pretty harmless,but witches and ghosts were all around the classroom.Seems to me that would be a bit distracting and depressing.

**spk_2:** [03:36.14 - 04:04.94] Well,they're not only in the classrooms.We've noticed that they even have most of the,uh,or I shouldn't say most of the,I've seen.Well,most of the city school buses that I've seen have got ghosts and,uh,goblins and witches,uh,hanging in the bus and on the very back windows.Uh,it's I don't know what it's like in other parts of the country,but I know that in Rhode Island it's a,it's a pretty big,pretty big event.

**spk_0:** [04:05.36 - 04:08.40] So what happened when you gave your objections to the teacher?

**spk_2:** [04:09.37 - 05:00.73] Well,she said that if we uh.That there really wasn't much she could do about it and she didn't know exactly how to advise us considering the extent of the use of the theme.So what'd you do next?Well,we,uh,I made an appointment with the principal the next day and uh.Expressed to her our concerns,and I had looked in the encyclopedia and done a few other things in light of the origins of Halloween and communicated our concerns to her.She said there was really nothing that she had the authority to do.But she would set up an appointment for me to meet with the superintendent of the school district and that if I really wanted to express our concerns to other parents,she would arrange a PTA meeting.So did

**spk_0:** [05:00.73 - 05:02.71] you do that?Yes,I did.And what happened?

**spk_2:** [05:03.72 - 06:41.12] Well,The superintendent Sent his deputy and we chatted.And the upshot of that was they suggested.They knew I was a lawyer and knew that I was contemplating maybe going to court on a church state issue since in Rhode Island they do recognize witchcraft as a legitimate religion.Uh,he said,let's just have a problem solving forum and process and work it out and discuss it and see if we couldn't come to some mutual,uh,decision 6 or 9 months down the road,but that there was nothing that they could do about it right now.I addressed the PTA.About the Halloween themes as well as the school mascot being a wizard,which,uh,as you may know,is a male witch,and in fact all the children carry home with them these,uh,heavy plastic,uh,folders they carry their papers in,and it's got a diagram illustration of a what looks like a witch.He's got a pointed hat and a wand and a robe.And the PTA,there were several parents who said they'd never really thought about these things.They were really glad to consider them.But most of the parents seemed to be.I wouldn't say most,but I'd say there was a vocal minority who were very much opposed to any changes whatsoever with either the school mascot or with the way they utilize Halloween in the schools,

**spk_0:** [06:41.20 - 06:44.74] and the majority of parents had probably never thought about it before you raised it,

**spk_2:** [06:44.92 - 07:02.19] right?I'd say the majority were silent and like hadn't really thought about it before.In fact,there was a principal of another elementary school in attendance.Who,uh,told me later that,uh,he'd never thought about these things and was going,was going to think about them more.

**spk_0:** [07:03.25 - 07:04.17] Well,so what happened?

**spk_2:** [07:04.37 - 07:47.14] Well,after that,uh,the,uh,I was informed I had referenced in my presentation to the PTA a detective of the local police department who is a real specialist in Satanism and the occult,uh,particularly among in the,the juvenile crime area,and he speaks 2 or 3 times a week to church groups and he's he's given a talk to the judges in the state on the,on the topic.And I referenced him a number of times and so the superintendent has arranged for this sergeant to give a presentation to a joint session of all the PTAs in the school district for November 28th.And so,

**spk_0:** [07:47.39 - 07:53.29] well,that's a very good outcome of your complaint,but meanwhile,what happened to the classes?

**spk_2:** [07:54.04 - 07:56.54] Well,there has not been any changes.

**spk_0:** [07:56.99 - 07:59.98] Did they,did they exempt your child from the class.

**spk_2:** [08:02.28 - 08:14.53] Well A couple of weeks ago,the 3rd grader's teacher read a No,they haven't excluded our sons or anything,and I have been asking daily about what's been going on.

**spk_0:** [08:14.73 - 08:20.45] Well,how did the teacher respond to this request that you take your child out of the Halloween lessons?Well,

**spk_2:** [08:20.52 - 08:37.33] the superintendent suggested that that's what the teachers do,that they exclude our sons from the Halloween related topics.The teachers came back and said that they would miss,uh,an inordinate amount of time from the classes in the month of October.

**spk_0:** [08:37.71 - 08:44.79] In other words,in other words,Halloween really preoccupied the entire lesson structure for October.That's,

**spk_2:** [08:45.00 - 09:10.71] that's what it appeared to mean.Uh,the superintendent said that then was no longer a possibility.Then he he said he would suggest to the teachers that they then just refrain from the Halloween theme in just our two sons' classes,uh,this time.Uh,in October,and the teachers objected and said that if they were forced to do that,they would file a grievance with the teachers union.In other words,

**spk_0:** [09:10.75 - 09:15.81] the teachers thought it was an interference with their rights not to be able to teach witchcraft to your child.

**spk_2:** [09:15.91 - 09:26.76] That's right.And so the superintendent said therefore he was not going to ask them to do it and it was just going to have to just be that way this time.And uh so anyway,well,

**spk_0:** [09:26.84 - 10:13.49] I think you,you see what the fight is in the public schools today.It's a fight between those people and they include members of the NEA and the ACLU who think they have a right to teach your child anything they want to teach,and it's none of your business,you parent.And then on the other hand,uh,the view that I support,which is that parents have a right to protect the religion and values of their children.Well,I think,yeah,I'm sure you can protect your children and explain to them what's wrong with these classes,and it is a one good result that you're going to have this expert come and address the teachers and the parents.Well,good luck,Bob.We,uh,we appreciate your sharing this with us,and,uh,we hope that you've opened the eyes of a lot of people about Halloween.

**spk_1:** [10:13.85 - 10:19.01] Do the teachers put this under the headline of witchcraft?No,

**spk_0:** [10:19.08 - 10:20.15] they call it Halloween,

**spk_1:** [10:20.41 - 10:22.87] uh-huh,but they never use the term witchcraft.

**spk_0:** [10:23.56 - 10:36.85] Uh,well,who knows what they use.They certainly use witches.There are all kinds of lessons that talk about witches,and many of them are very horrible and scary people who frighten the children.Well,let's go to our next call.It's Drury

**spk_1:** [10:36.85 - 10:39.61] in La Puente,California for Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [10:39.89 - 10:43.91] Hello,Drury.Uh,we want to hear about your Halloween experience.

**spk_3:** [10:44.61 - 10:57.86] Well,my Halloween experience is a,is an ongoing thing,as,as your previous caller was saying.I'm basically,I'm calling to bring you up to date on what's happening in the Hacienda La Puente School District since I called

**spk_0:** [10:57.86 - 10:59.32] last.That's in California,right?

**spk_3:** [10:59.50 - 11:13.75] Yes,ma'am.And the school district has taken the children's readers,that is the,the impression series readers published by Holt,Reinhardt and Winston of Canada out of the classrooms,grades 1 through 6 for 3 weeks of evaluation.

**spk_0:** [11:16.09 - 11:23.06] And do you have any knowledge of how that's going,or this was the result of your complaint,was it?

**spk_3:** [11:23.41 - 11:35.86] This was the result of many parents' complaints who got together and came in front of the school board about,well,between 500 and 1000 of us to bring these complaints forward.

**spk_0:** [11:35.96 - 11:38.44] 1000 parents showed up at the school board meeting.

**spk_3:** [11:39.40 - 11:41.58] Yes,ma'am.There was a lot of us there.That must

**spk_0:** [11:41.58 - 11:43.18] have been a lively school board meeting.

**spk_3:** [11:43.32 - 11:46.12] It was.It continued until around 1 o'clock in the morning.

**spk_0:** [11:46.39 - 11:55.36] And was it mostly about the,the witchcraft and,and the cult references in these readers in the elementary grades?Yes,

**spk_3:** [11:55.43 - 11:58.06] it sure was.That was the biggest complaint of all.

**spk_0:** [11:59.27 - 12:15.33] And uh so now as a result of that protest,uh,the school has pulled uh the the readers out of the classroom for the time being.Did they set up a commission or a task force to go over the books and do you have any input into that?

**spk_3:** [12:16.16 - 12:35.16] They basically are going through,we're going through the same syndrome that they went through in Washington with this impression series where.They are reviewing and they're the story is that they didn't get the readers they asked for.They got the wrong edition.Well,the same thing happened in Washington.They got,

**spk_0:** [12:35.20 - 12:40.96] in other words,in other words,they're trying to absolve themselves of responsibility for selecting these bad readers.

**spk_3:** [12:41.18 - 12:42.34] Yeah,that's,that's correct.

**spk_0:** [12:43.47 - 12:44.16] Well,go on.

**spk_3:** [12:44.67 - 12:54.75] Uh,it's,it's just hard to believe some of the what they're doing basically though is they're stalling because there's an election coming up and after the election they won't have to deal with this.

**spk_0:** [12:54.91 - 12:58.99] When is the election?Pardon?When is the election?November 6th.

**spk_3:** [12:59.21 - 12:59.47] It was

**spk_0:** [12:59.47 - 13:00.31] for the school board,

**spk_3:** [13:00.47 - 13:02.43] right?There's 3 seats up for election.

**spk_0:** [13:02.70 - 13:04.82] And have you made this a big issue in the election?

**spk_3:** [13:05.71 - 13:08.05] Yes,we have.It's the big issue.

**spk_0:** [13:08.57 - 13:17.03] Uh huh.Well,I hope you have a candidate who is going to be sensitive to parental rights and going to respect your input and your criticisms.

**spk_3:** [13:17.35 - 13:24.75] Oh yeah,we have at least one for certain.And I believe we do have 3 good candidates that can fill those seats.

**spk_0:** [13:25.14 - 13:36.25] Well,tell us a little more about the curriculum itself.Um,did they,they have stories about witches?Did they describe what witches do,that sort of thing?

**spk_3:** [13:36.83 - 13:45.88] They do all of the above,and it's,it's,as your previous caller said,it's all throughout.One story here is called The Dream Eater.This is for the 2nd graders.

**spk_0:** [13:46.16 - 13:47.85] Dream Eater.Yes,

**spk_3:** [13:48.40 - 14:22.47] and the teacher's note on the story tells them to ask the children if they would like any of their dreams taken away by magic,and it's a story of a boy who dreams he's being chased by a 3-headed demon upon a dragon with 20 eyes and a creature called Backy who devours dreams.Then there's another story.This is out of the teacher's anthology that they read to the children.This describes the process of mummification and removing of their brains through the nostrils with metal hooks,also making a slit in the body and taking out the liver,lungs,stomach,and intestines.

**spk_0:** [14:22.63 - 14:25.23] This sounds pretty scary for 2nd and 3rd graders.

**spk_3:** [14:25.39 - 14:27.19] It,it sure does.A dreary,

**spk_0:** [14:27.27 - 14:41.84] dreary,we'd like to know.A little bit more about this impressions course.So we have to break for some announcements,but if you'd stand by,I'd like you to tell our listeners a little bit more about what's actually in this Holt Reinhardt impression series.And there's

**spk_4:** [16:14.84 - 16:15.39] west we're

**spk_1:** [16:15.39 - 16:16.94] standing.From the

**spk_4:** [16:16.94 - 16:16.95] north

**spk_1:** [16:18.82 - 16:19.97] to the south we're standing

**spk_4:** [16:20.24 - 16:20.31] proud.

**spk_1:** [16:23.50 - 17:30.02] trees standing Like I From anywhere in America,the toll-free number on Phyllis-Schlafly Live is 1-800-736-3202.Some interesting conversation about what's happening in the public schools during the Halloween season,and we're talking with Drury in La Puente,

**spk_0:** [17:30.33 - 17:49.48] California.I want to go back to Drury.Are you there?We've had a number of calls from other listeners and at our Parents advisory Center about this impression series,and I,and all the complaints are not about witchcraft.And I would like to know if if you have some comment about what else is in the course.

**spk_3:** [17:50.18 - 17:50.19] Well,

**spk_0:** [17:51.39 - 17:55.85] in other words,it's a,it's a whole,it's a whole language arts program,isn't it?

**spk_3:** [17:56.21 - 18:39.02] That's right.It's a,it is a,it's a whole language curriculum and it,and it appears to me to be a big mistake because the children are no longer taught to spell.Uh,as an example in Fly Away Home,which is,uh,out of the 3rd grade reader,the children are told,here's,it's,uh,out of the teacher's resource book page 144,it says invented spelling,encourage children to use invented spelling rather than stop the flow of language in order to look up or ask for spellings.The children who invent.Spelling have better understanding of how words and letters fit together and they will gradually move towards standard spelling through logical developmental stages.

**spk_0:** [18:39.61 - 18:59.91] Oh,that's outrageous,but uh uh it looks to me like they want to do to English uh what they've done to social studies and that is.Mix up history and geography so much that they can't find the United States on the world map and now in language arts,uh,they're not teaching them spelling.How about grammar?Are they using grammar?

**spk_3:** [19:00.11 - 19:10.88] No,grammar and punctuation follows the same program.They,they,they are to write it the way they want and then if the teacher feels like it,she's to correct it and let them see it.

**spk_0:** [19:10.98 - 19:22.11] Well,no wonder they can't write a letter to apply for a job when they get out of school.And this is called the Language Arts Program.Is it all published by Holt,Reinhardt,and Winston?

**spk_3:** [19:22.52 - 19:43.61] No,it's a,it's a statewide curriculum that's been adopted by the state for all of our schools.And it's,there are,there are approximately 15 different publishers to choose from.Who supply the materials for the curriculum,but it's all based on the same program.

**spk_0:** [19:44.56 - 20:07.72] Well,in other words,if they're not going to teach them to spell,uh,grammar,punctuation,how to write coherent sentences so that people can understand it,uh,then,um,they will simply contribute to these 27 million functional illiterates that we've already got out there,and I suppose the whole testing program will disguise what they haven't learned.

**spk_3:** [20:08.46 - 20:24.88] Uh,that's the plan.Many districts have already,uh,they're not going to use the Iowa skill test or any other recognized form of evaluation for the children because their progress,it,it would,they wouldn't score well,uh,in any of the skills that'd be tested in this language area.

**spk_0:** [20:25.50 - 20:48.90] Well,Drury,I think you have some great issues for your school board election coming up.Most people do want their children to be able to write,uh,and read the English language,and I want them to be able to write a,a sentence and spell the words and have a,a subject and a predicate,and,uh,I think you have a great issue to.Elect some new members to your school board.We wish you good luck and we thank you for sharing with us today.

**spk_1:** [20:49.20 - 21:02.04] And from anywhere in America,1-800-736-3202.Incidentally,the best time to get a hold of us is when you hear someone hang up.Let's move out to Hawaii over KLHT.And here's Kevin,Phyllis.

**spk_0:** [21:02.16 - 21:11.89] Hello,Kevin.Hello.Oh,thanks.What's your question or comment?Can you talk a little louder?We're having trouble getting you all the way from Hawaii.

**spk_3:** [21:13.13 - 21:13.60] OK,yeah,

**spk_0:** [21:13.61 - 21:13.82] that's better.

**spk_3:** [21:15.15 - 21:56.74] Can you hear me now?Yes.OK.Um,I used to be dabbling into the occult before I came to Christ.And something I noticed is there's so many college classes that teach occult and witchcraft with hidden,with,with names to hide it.And also,I've noticed too in years that um the witchcraft in a cult is being promoted through the media like talk shows,especially TV shows,the sitcoms.I've noticed there's a lot of cult in there and even so far as documentaries,and I just wonder if y'all had any um Uh,thing to back this up or any information on this at all.

**spk_0:** [21:57.92 - 22:37.51] No,I'm dimly aware that that is going on,but the focus of this program is what's going on in the elementary and secondary schools.Do you have any particular knowledge about that?But,but you have spotted witchcraft courses at the college level.I know that goes on,and I have heard about,uh,meetings of witches on college campuses,and I have,uh,noticed in a number of the,uh,the descriptions of women's studies courses that sometimes the course on witchcraft is included.So I think,uh,the public should be alert to that and we thank you for bringing it to our attention.We appreciate your call telephone.

**spk_1:** [22:37.66 - 22:40.44] Phone call.Here's Ronnie in Jacksonville,Florida.Hello,

**spk_0:** [22:40.45 - 22:43.60] Ronnie.Hi P Phyllis.What is your question or comment?

**spk_5:** [22:43.72 - 23:21.96] Well,I'm a very concerned mother.I have,uh,3 children,one who's now attending 11th grade,one who's attending 4th grade,and one who's attending 2nd.Ah,as a family we've been very blessed.Up until this year.Our children have been all able to attend Christian school.Our 11th grader is still in Christian school,but our 4th grader and our 2nd grader are now attending public school.So we're running into public school problems and Of course I haven't been into the public school system in over 23 years and it's

**spk_0:** [23:21.96 - 23:24.31] changed in 20 years,Ronnie.Oh my,

**spk_5:** [23:24.77 - 25:11.95] it sure has,and uh,I have a tremendous burden here,and I don't know what to do about it.My hands are kind of really tied.I've called a lot,a lot of people anyways.My concern is,is my 4th grader,OK,I've had a few discussions with her teacher already for a certain.Things that went on in the classroom that were,you know,very unscriptural,and,um,I also talked with the principal about it.Now,my child,um just joined.The 4th grade children's library book club.OK,this week she came home with a book This Place Has No Atmosphere by,um,Paula Danzinger.I don't know if you're familiar.No,I'm not.Well,right,you know,right in the first,uh,right on the 2nd page,it's,uh,this particular girl,she's talking about,uh,one of the boys in class and how,um,The school,the,the vice president,uh,the vice principal happens to be upset with him because,um,he used his telekinetic powers,causing the principal to be flying up the flagpole and right in the,right on the 6th page,and my daughter says,first of all,she comes home from school and says,Mommy,can I read this book to you?And I said,Yes.So we went in my bedroom and she began to read it to me and as she read it to me,she read,you know,she said telekinetic powers.I said,Stop right there,Rachel.You don't have to go any further.And she said,Why,Mommy,is that bad?And I said,Yes,it is.Telek telekinetic powers is satanic.It's from the devil.Any powers that we get other than Jesus is not,you know,it's,it's satanic.And so then she said,OK,fine,no problem.And I said,You are no longer to be in the book club.Uh,take out no more books from the school library until I can,you know,do a further investigation.All right,

**spk_0:** [25:12.04 - 25:22.03] now tell me,how did she get this particular book?Was it given to her?Was it on a list of the librarian selected for her,or did she just walk,the child walk in just blind and pick something off the shelf?

**spk_5:** [25:22.17 - 25:38.87] Yeah,she just walked in and picked something off the shelf,and right on the 6th page here it has ESP.You know,it's again it's talking about this girl of the book,and,um,she's saying now this boy should know,ah,I like him after all,he's into ESP.So,

**spk_0:** [25:39.82 - 26:02.66] well,the,the problem is the 4th grader doesn't have the judgment to walk into a library with thousands of books and pick out a good book,and it is my hope with Eagle-Forum that one of these days we're going to be able to put out a list to guide parents like you so that you can make a wide selection of,of good inspirational,uplifting,important stories to give to your children.

**spk_5:** [26:03.41 - 26:10.61] Yeah,right,the 2nd day of school,uh,my daughter's teacher used a relaxation technique in the classroom.We talked

**spk_0:** [26:10.61 - 26:43.45] about that last week.That's one of the new age techniques that that are just coming into schools all over,and they say,don't you want to eliminate stress among your children?Well,of course you do,but you don't want them to be led into the practices of the Eastern mystical religions.Absolutely.Well,I think you've learned already,Ronnie,that you have to,uh,you have to keep track daily of what your child is reading,what the textbooks are,what are the library books that they pick out,and you have to be on guard.Right.

**spk_5:** [26:44.42 - 27:47.54] But Phyllis,my concern now,yes,it is for my children.In fact,I called somebody who was here in Jacksonville that was supposed to be,ah,heavy into,um,the anti-abortion as well as the books in school.I called them and somebody told me that,you know,I,you know,I could just give up because and and pull my kids out of the public school and put them back into Christian school because nobody is concerned.Nobody wants to get involved,and,um.I didn't,I didn't receive that as,as a word of discouragement that I could pull my kids out,right,and I spent the day last week with,um,my kindergarten child in school.Ah,and brought,you know,ah,3 dozen cupcakes,and I,the week before I,I spent the day with my 4th grader in school and did the same thing.We had a wonderful time and,ah,the children all sent me notes,appreciation notes,and,um,really touched my heart,you know.So now I don't only have a burden for my own kids but for the other children.

**spk_0:** [27:47.64 - 28:25.36] Well,that's right,and there,there are,ah,many of the schools have the attitude.That if,if you look like you're going to be a troublemaker and object,then we urge you to pull your child out and then when leadership disappears then they can do what they want to with the other children and I,I thank you for your concern for all the other children who are getting these bad courses and techniques in the classroom so keep track of it keep uh um keep watching it,uh,subscribe to our.Education reporter,so you will be alert to what is going on and we'll try to give you every help.Thank you for sharing with us today,Ronnie.

**spk_1:** [28:25.58 - 28:32.82] Phyllis,I think it's real important that we define witchcraft and how it differs from Satanism.

**spk_0:** [28:33.06 - 28:43.42] Well,witchcraft has to do with sorcery,magic,black magic,the use of magical powers and influences,and that obviously.No place in the public school classroom,

**spk_1:** [28:43.44 - 29:05.92] and that is indeed what we're talking about today.And if you'd like to join us,of course we'd like to hear from you.As a matter of fact,we'll pay for the telephone call at 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.Look forward to hearing from you,and we will return on the USA Radio Network with Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_4:** [29:08.83 - 30:10.35] Child abuse in the classroom.You've heard callers on radio live with Phyllis Schlaffly mention it many times.It is the best tool for explaining the changes that have occurred in education in the last 15 years and contains actual testimony from parents,students,and educators given at 7 regional US Department of Education hearings.Over 200,000 copies of child abuse in the classroom have been sold.Read a copy yourself and give one to a friend.Or if you want to inform those who don't have time to read,buy the video tape which is narrated by Phyllis.The best way to alert your community to the problems in the public schools is to show this video to a group of your friends.Order your copy of Eagle Forum's Child Abuse in the Classroom,the book for 495,or the video for 2195.Write Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.That address again is Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [30:15.54 - 30:30.34] If you're just joining us,the program is Phyllis-Schlafly Live across America on the USA Radio Network.We're talking about what the public schools do in Halloween.We invite your telephone calls 1-800-736-3202.

**spk_0:** [30:30.64 - 30:43.27] We've been talking about witchcraft and Halloween in the public schools.A lot of schools spend so much time on this,it's not an academic.Subject and witchcraft is a religion.It has no place in the public school classroom.

**spk_1:** [30:43.34 - 30:53.16] And our listeners have lots of interesting questions and comments to throw your way,Phyllis.So let's jump back in.Here's Karen in Indianapolis over at WXIR.

**spk_0:** [30:53.46 - 34:29.26] Hello Karen.What is your question or comment?Well,I,I had a situation earlier in the month and I debated on.Because I had told the principal that I would drop the subject after it happened,but I really felt like parents need to be aware of what is going on in the public schools.That's why we have this program,Karen,because if I just told all these things,they might think I made them up,but you tell your firsthand experience.My firsthand experience was the first week in October.Before October 13th happened,um,my daughter's classroom had all been asked to wear black for October 13th.Um,we are a Christian family,and I was just very appalled at this.And what grade was this?This was the 4th grade.Well,most 4th graders don't have any black dress or suit,do they?Well,they wanted him to wear black.The teacher had requested this.Uh,I wrote a note to the school,to the teacher,um,and perhaps my wording wasn't quite right,but I just relayed my,um,You know,my fears,you know,that that this was a satanic type thing that,you know,someone would do and that I didn't feel like there was any place for it.And what happened in public schools,the teacher was very angry.She felt like that I had accused her of being a Satan worshiper,and I was sorry that she took it that way because that really wasn't my intent.My intent was to explain our beliefs and that our daughter wouldn't participate.Um,did you send,did you send your child to school without wearing black?Yes,she wore blue and white that day.And was she the only one in the class like that?Um,there were some kids that did wear black,but the teacher the day before when I had sent the note had told the kids that,you know,there was a mother that was quite upset and that they didn't have to wear black.And then that day I had also had to go to the school to a conference with the teacher and with the principal.Um,we chose to change our daughter's classroom,which also the the teacher,the teacher had also requested that we do.Um,she didn't,she felt like that everything that she did the rest of the year would be put under a microscope,in her words.Um,well,it's,it's too bad that she took that personally and was so defensive about it.It seems to me you have a right to dress your child the way you want to.Um,I was just very concerned of the symbolism,and which she denied knowing anything about this type of symbolism.I was the wearing a black also able to tell me that this was the first Friday,the 13th that had fallen in the month of October for 17 years.Well,so what?So what?Aren't they supposed to be learning how to read and write?I think so.Well,I,uh,had,uh,have you worked it out?You put the child in another class now,right?Right.And things are fine now.Um,there was just,you know,quite a misunderstanding that the teacher did take it very personal.Well,it's too bad she took it personally,and,uh,I,uh,I,I hope you can just simply make the school understand that you want to stand up for your values,and they should be sensitive to your values and respected.I believe they do now,but I think that parents really need to be aware.That things like this are going on in the classroom.Well,thank you so much,Karen,for calling.We appreciate your sharing.Fort Walton Beach

**spk_1:** [34:29.26 - 34:32.21] is the next stop,WPSM,and here's

**spk_0:** [34:32.21 - 34:37.14] Charles.Hello,Charles.Yes ma'am.Tell us,what is your question or comment.I have

**spk_6:** [34:37.14 - 35:13.45] two specific areas.One,I found out recently that here the Okaloosa County school system is incorporating in the elementary schools the do so curriculum.10 of the 20 elementary schools carry it.I've been trying to get more information on it.I talked to the principal of the school.He set me up with an appointment with a guidance counselor.I talked to one of the school board members to try to get the curriculum.What I'm wondering is,is what exactly is entailed in the do so curriculum,what age groups it involves,and what areas can I concentrate on in order to get to the heart of the matter when I meet with this school guidance counselor?

**spk_0:** [35:13.65 - 36:22.67] Well,Charles,I would suggest for starters you get the cassette of our Phyllis-Schlafly Live program.Last Saturday when we discussed the do so program and uh described it in detail as it was used in New Mexico,it's in a number of grade levels.It does go into a lot of these new age practices that many of us find so offensive in the schools.Uh,we do have a couple of articles as well as this cassette which you can get for $5 by writing to us.Uh,we are familiar with some of the controversy in the Okaloosa school system.We had an article about that in the Education Reporter.And the techniques that are used in that are,are very offensive to to Christians and to believers because they use the practices that are common among these Eastern mystical religions practices such as centering,telling the children that there's a space inside of you where some of these spirit guides can come in and guide you,and that is hostile to our religion extremely.Well,we do thank you for calling and we'll be happy to supply you with information if you'll write to Eagle-Forum.

**spk_6:** [36:22.75 - 37:11.07] OK.One other point too,it has to do with the Halloween.Also,they were having what they're calling a Halloween parade or something,and we were informed if we don't want our children to participate,they don't have to.Then the next day we get a note that a pumpkin was carved in the classroom.It was taken by democracy of the children.They took a vote.It would have been an angry face,a happy face,a demonic face,such and such.And then they also used while they were carving it,they were taking measurements to see its circumference,how much it weighed,and all this stuff to try to put some math into it.But all at the same time they were in the classroom carving a pumpkin,which we don't allow our children to do,and we were not informed of this until after it was finished.Now we have not got in touch with the school to say we didn't appreciate this,but most assuredly we will.Well,we didn't hear anything about it.No one said anything.

**spk_0:** [37:11.51 - 37:35.50] Nobody,nobody told you ahead of time.I would suggest,Charles,that with all the bad things there are in the schools,fighting the pumpkin wouldn't be the place where I would rest my case.There,the,the actual use of witches and telling them what witches do is so much more objectionable.So that's my help.suggestion.Uh,we appreciate your call and let's try to take another call before the break.

**spk_1:** [37:35.72 - 37:41.78] Want to welcome a new station in Duluth,Minnesota,WWJC,and our first caller from there,

**spk_0:** [37:42.02 - 37:45.66] Laurie.Hello,Laurie.Hi.What is your question or comment?

**spk_7:** [37:45.78 - 38:28.89] I have a comment.First,I'd like to thank you for your show.I think it's excellent.We really need it in our school,for the schools,definitely.I want to share an experience that's been going on with us,especially during the past week with occultism in the school.I wrote a note to my son's school requesting he stay out of the time class when the counselor comes in.They did.After I wrote this letter,they put him back into the class.The counselor called me and I asked her why was my son put back in,and she said,I thought you changed your mind.I said,No,I did not change my mind.He is to be withheld permanently out of your class.I told her I would meet with her and I would tell her why,you know,I was objecting to the program.I thought I owed her that.Now wait

**spk_0:** [38:28.89 - 38:32.71] a minute,what program is it and does the counselor come in regularly for the class?

**spk_7:** [38:32.85 - 38:45.14] Yes,the counselor comes in regularly for this.I asked her if it was part of the human growth development curriculum.I wanted a title.She could not give me a title,but she told me,no,it is not part of the human growth and development curriculum.

**spk_0:** [38:45.26 - 38:47.84] Well,what does the counselor do when she comes in the classroom?Well,

**spk_7:** [38:47.91 - 40:09.99] I asked her that,and she said,I do not counsel.I do not give therapy.She said,I teach them on interpersonal relationships,how to handle conflicts,this type of thing,and our son does have a behavior problem,and she feels very strongly that he needs this.I told her that if we did decide to go with counseling,it would be from a Bible-based Christian fundamental therapist who we choose,not through the school,and to say the least,she was just horrified that I would even say anything like this.I proceeded to tell her that I,I objected to her techniques such as the guided imagery,visualization,the do so that was in the school.And she asked why I was against to do so.I said,and I quoted from Johanna Michaelson's book and from your book,uh,child abuse in the classroom through this whole meeting.If I quoted from the book,I was told I'm taking things out of context,and if I gave them my feelings,I was told I was wrong.I told them that guided imagery leads to 42 different types of techniques to introduce children to spirit entities,and they just could not believe it.They told me that this type of curriculum is not in their schools.They have strict guidelines to follow,and this will not be done in their school.This was 9 o'clock Thursday morning.2 o'clock my son comes home and said,Guess what,Mom?We took a break from my speech class today and we played a game called Castle.

**spk_0:** [40:10.15 - 40:16.29] Laurie,we're,we're out of time.Hang on,I'll let you finish the sentence after we have a break for announcements.OK?And he

**spk_7:** [40:16.29 - 40:17.65] played Castle and Dragons.

**spk_1:** [40:17.75 - 41:22.75] Hang on there.Hang on there.We're anxious to hear it on Philly Schlafly Live.Eagle-Forum Education wants to keep you up to date on current legislation affecting our public schools.That's why you need to subscribe to The Education Reporter.The Education Reporter is a monthly newsletter that keeps you informed on what the public schools are really doing.Read the alarming news on how ACLU policies are impacting education today.And how abstinence now continues to be the theme in discussions of sex education across America despite opposition from Planned Parenthood and the ACLU.The education reporter is must reading if you have children in the public schools.Plus,this newsletter would be a practical gift idea for someone you know in the field of education.For an annual subscription,send $25 to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Eagle is spelled like the American Eagle,Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [42:25.45 - 42:37.57] Welcome back on the USA Radio Network.The call-in program is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and Phyllis,we're talking with Laurie over WWJC in Duluth,Minnesota,and this is the stuff cliffhangers are made out of,

**spk_0:** [42:37.85 - 42:45.01] right,Laurie,we have lots of calls waiting.Uh,we'll let you finish this exciting story we were,uh,that you were in when we were running out of time.OK,

**spk_7:** [42:45.09 - 43:20.11] I just wanted to state that after I Guaranteed these type of occult practices were not in my school.In my son's speech class,he played Castle and Dragons.He came home with a little surprise that he had won.It had one eye and a pitchfork in the hand.I mean,it is there in the schools.And what grade was he in?He's in 3rd grade.3rd grade,3rd grade,yes,and they have since,they have,ever since I wrote these letters.Withholding him from these classes,they have been suspending my child.They have done,I mean,twice they've suspended him for they've said his behavior is unsafe.I have wrote

**spk_0:** [43:20.25 - 43:22.81] after,after they gave him a story about a pitchfork,

**spk_7:** [43:23.61 - 43:24.17] pardon me,

**spk_0:** [43:24.37 - 43:30.07] after they gave him the story about the pitchfork,and they said he was unsafe.Sounds to me like the story's unsafe.

**spk_7:** [43:31.41 - 43:47.69] Absolutely.So I mean the problem is really out there and we are looking for different alternatives for his schooling,but I mean,and you try to present this to these people and they do take it personally like the previous caller had said the teacher,you know,like she had accused her of demon worship and that's the way they look at you.

**spk_0:** [43:48.12 - 43:53.93] Well,you're just standing up for your rights,and we do encourage you.We'll try to give you every help and thank you for calling today.

**spk_1:** [43:54.14 - 43:57.40] And here's Tom over at WXIR in Minneapolis.

**spk_0:** [43:57.49 - 44:00.47] Hello Tom.What is your question or comment?

**spk_3:** [44:01.43 - 44:09.85] Well,I just tuned into your wonderful program,and I believe that you're trying to accomplish a great amount of good by doing it.

**spk_0:** [44:10.07 - 44:14.08] Do you have some experience with Halloween or witches in the schools?

**spk_3:** [44:14.42 - 44:42.94] Yes,I'm talking to you from a school in Indianapolis right now.That has actually been converted into a church building.And,ah,we have contacted some of the Indianapolis,ah,writers here of a paper that is sent just to children called Indy's Child.And they're having like a haunted house kind of thing in Indianapolis now.

**spk_0:** [44:42.97 - 44:44.40] Is this in the public school?

**spk_3:** [44:45.29 - 45:29.66] Well,this is affecting the children that are in the schools,and we get the reports,you know,praying for people here of the troubles that they're experiencing in the schools.And so what we're suggesting is that the children do not,um,you know,buy candy or things for Halloween and instead,ah,encourage their friends not to do it also.And by putting that good report into the school ahead of time,we're going to be having revival every night here and praying for people until and through that Monday night where the devil ordinarily tries to celebrate this holiday,but we're completely taking it over.In Jesus' name in Indianapolis.

**spk_0:** [45:29.82 - 45:34.60] Well,that's very fine.We appreciate your sharing that with us and thank you for your call.

**spk_1:** [45:34.82 - 45:43.20] And we travel out to South Jacksonville,Illinois over KSIV and for one of America's most admired and respected women,here's Cindy.

**spk_0:** [45:43.44 - 48:13.62] Hello,Cindy.Hello.What is your question or comment?Well,it's talk a little bit louder,Cindy.It's comments and questions.I'm just now becoming more and more aware of the promotion of occult paraphernalia and other occult things in the school that my daughter,who is in 5th grade,is,uh,coming in contact with,and I've pretty much met with,um,unfortunately I'm not in a united front home.And if it comes right down to the uh the line,I,I would not have an opportunity to take my daughter from the school,so I'm trying to walk.You know,a thin line here.I've tried to talk with some parents about what I'm finding out,and the reactions are basically,well,the less said the better,or,well,you know,don't,don't get into these things that deep,you know,it's not what she's,what I found.Well,I think you'd be,you'd be better off to pick whatever you think is the most objectionable and make a very reasoned case against that with the teacher and then with the principal.Because it is very difficult for one person to fight on all fronts without any help,and you do do need some other parents to join with you.Mhm.Well,one of my main problems right now is that my daughter is in a student assistant team where she has been um.She's supposed to wear,uh,sell school supplies.Well,for the month of October,the school supplies have included little witch erasers and skulls and skeletons and witches' fingers and werewolves and uh jack o lanterns and monster things.Is she required to participate in this?Um,well,see,this is,this again,you know,I,I'm at a point right now where I'm not knowing.Exactly what to do if I go in and start,again,if I,if I'm doing this,I've tried to contact some parents to see what they're feeling,you know,if,if my daughter would go in at Christmas time with some nativity sets.Uh,with baby Jesus,um,she wouldn't even be able to get on the school ground.Yes,you've got the picture,and that is the problem,and we encourage you to stand up for your rights and to try to alert other parents.We're going to move along to another call because we have so many,but we appreciate your calling us in Modesto

**spk_1:** [48:13.62 - 48:15.71] over KCIV.It's Fred.

**spk_0:** [48:16.04 - 48:18.52] Hello Fred,how are you?What is your question or comment?

**spk_8:** [48:18.97 - 49:21.36] Actually,I just have a couple of very quick comments if I could.Um,a couple of the,one of the callers before had mentioned about the,uh,teacher who thought that the parent was accusing them of being a Satanist.Well,the concern for me as a parent would be I might be inclined to believe that the teacher might in fact be dabbling in that because she was so quick to rise to the defense without the without the parent accusing her.So in,in the public school,I'm a teacher in the Christian school system.My teacher is a,uh,my wife is a teacher,excuse me,in the public school system,and that kind of stuff,I think,goes on more often than parents are very,very aware of it.The second comment I would have would be with respect to the whole language.I think,I don't want to take you out of context and I hope I didn't misunderstand you,but in,in general,I agree with what you're saying.I believe that the whole language is gonna go.I think it's going to go down the tubes hopefully because I think if it doesn't,it's going to bring a nation down the tubes with it,but there are some good components to the whole language system.In other words,for instance,teaching across the curriculum and blending certain things so that it makes more sense to the students and also reinforcing the facts.

**spk_0:** [49:21.50 - 49:26.53] But well,you're talking about the whole language method of teaching reading.Pardon me,is that

**spk_8:** [49:26.53 - 49:26.62] what

**spk_0:** [49:26.62 - 49:30.78] you're talking about,the whole language method of teaching reading?Yes,and,

**spk_8:** [49:30.89 - 49:37.62] and that.Disagree with.I disagree with.I think that we have to go back to phonics and basils and all of that.I really do.Well,

**spk_0:** [49:37.81 - 49:43.72] uh,so do I,and we appreciate you saying that.We're,we're out of time,but thank you very much for calling in.

**spk_1:** [49:44.09 - 49:59.09] And we're going to get your closing statements on this whole matter of Halloween witchcraft and what the public schools are doing to ring in Halloween this 1989.Stay with us on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_9:** [50:03.12 - 51:02.17] Too many children have been cheated out of the education they deserve.Did you know that nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science?That's a problem we can no longer afford to ignore.Educational excellence in the public school starts with respect for the rights of students,parents,and taxpayers.But what are they?Every student has the right to be taught to read the English language in the first grade.Every student has the right to family privacy,the right to his religious faith and beliefs,the right to share information with his parents.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy from Eagle-Forum.Learn more about the rights you and your children should expect.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy by writing Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_0:** [52:05.86 - 52:46.29] I think you've seen on this program today how many parents have called in from all over the country to tell their experiences of finding what's what is being taught during October on Halloween,on witchcraft,on magical powers,on black magic,on all sorts of courses that are not academic and have no place in the public school classroom because they are offensive to the First Amendment rights of those of us who believe in God.I urge you to go to your schools and find out what they did teach this year about Halloween during October and then you can make a presentation to eliminate this type of anti-religious teaching next year in the schools.
