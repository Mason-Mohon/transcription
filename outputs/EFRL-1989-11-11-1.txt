**spk_0:** [00:02.14 - 02:29.37] Role playing is a dangerous psychological tool.The role playing game Dungeons and Dragons has been used in public schools sometimes with dire results.Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.This is Bruce Hayes inviting you to stay with us for the next hour.We have an interesting program lined up for our listeners today,Phyllis,and of course they're invited to join us.So jot down our toll-free number anywhere in America 1-800-736-3202.Our special guest is the author of a new book called The Devil's Web Who's Stalking Your Children for Satan.Mrs.Pat Pulling is a licensed private investigator and leading authority on the occult.She's well known to police investigators all over the country for her work in this area,and she serves on many boards specializing in ritualistic crime and cult crime.That's right,Bruce.Is pulling as one of the top authorities in the country on the occult.She's the founder of an organization to help parents called BADD,that stands for Bothered about Dungeons and Dragons.The reason we're so glad to have Mrs.Pulling on this program is her motivation for getting involved in this.She lost her 17 year old son as a result of playing Dungeons and Dragons in his public school.Where one of the teachers acted as dungeon master,Mrs.Poling is going to share her expertise with us today.She's on the line with us from her home in Virginia.And let me remind our listeners that Phyllis and our special guest will be taking your calls later in the program,but I encourage you to get in now while the lines are free.We're at 1-800-736.63202 again that's 1-800-736-3202.Now let's go to Richmond,Virginia and talk with Mrs.Pulling.Hello Pat.Thank you for joining us today.I read your book on the plane yesterday and I'm very impressed.We're going to talk about that,uh,but first of all,let's put this in focus.I think many of us had various.Childhood fantasies we might have dreamed of of riding on the magic carpet or if uh you were a boy you might have dreamed of slaying dragons or if you were a girl you might have dreamed of being in a in a tower where a prince would come and rescue you.So what's the matter with having these fantasies?

**spk_1:** [02:29.71 - 03:02.62] Well,I think fantasy in and of itself is very good and fantasy role playing can be very good.I think what the problem is,and certainly even with games like Dungeons and Dragons,the fantasies don't have to go to the extreme amounts of violence and the extreme authentic occult material in the violent aspects that in some games this does go.Uh,a lot of kids start out playing basic Dungeons and Dragons and don't go on to higher levels and do not get obsessed with the violence and the the love of violence in the game.

**spk_0:** [03:04.23 - 03:20.66] Well,uh,tell us about your experience with Dungeons and Dragons in the schools.It's one thing for children to go to a store,buy a game,engage in some type of outside activity,but the thing that really concerns us on this program is how it's used in the schools.

**spk_1:** [03:20.83 - 04:28.23] Well,in my particular situation,the teachers,there were two teachers,uh,involved,a female teacher in the talented and gifted class.Uh,who invited an English teacher who had a free period to come in to teach and play Dungeons and Dragons as a reward for good behavior in the talented and gifted class in my son's junior year of high school.Now in the game of Dungeons and Dragons and many other games very similar to it,one of the objections that I certainly have with this type of material in a public school system is that it not only talks about fantasy,but a lot of this is not fantasy.A lot of what they're calling mythology and fantasy is in fact authentic occult religions that are practiced today with the various gods and deities and demigods.That are protected and practiced under the First Amendment of the Constitution.So I think to promote religious philosophies of this nature,since we cannot promote any religious philosophies and doing it through the guise of a game is certainly not being fair to consumers nor to public school and public education.

**spk_0:** [04:28.65 - 04:38.64] Dungeons and Dragons is a game that you buy in a in a game store.Uh,what does it cost?$20 or something like that?Uh,you,you can.Yes.

**spk_1:** [04:38.72 - 05:10.00] Oh my goodness,Dungeons and Dragons is not a board game.It is a role playing game,and what you do is you buy manuals,books.These books will range in price from 1195 to 1,595 per book.The advanced dungeons.Dragons set has a number of master manuals over 9 now which are hard bound books.Uh,they are very complex and it requires a lot of time to read and understand your role playing characters in the game.

**spk_0:** [05:10.60 - 05:20.88] Then they do go for the smarter kids in the class,right,because we only have encountered this in the uh the the better students,the talented and gifted classes.

**spk_1:** [05:21.04 - 06:04.76] Well,I would say that certainly we have encountered kids who have been involved in Dungeons and Dragons that are.Not in the talented and gifted classes,uh,only because they may have friends who are in the talented and gifted classes and can lead them through the roles,but in 1982,the manufacturer of this particular game hired Doctor Joyce Brothers to do a,a nationwide tour.In which she and a spokesman from the company went to major cities including Richmond and had parties or had receptions at specific hotels such as the Richmond Hyatt and invited high school librarians,principals,and teachers to promote this in the talented and gifted class to stimulate creativity and reading and math skills.

**spk_0:** [06:05.15 - 06:14.94] Well,that was just a marketing program by the manufacturer.That wasn't any disinterested advice by Joyce Brothers who holds herself out as somebody who gives advice to young people.

**spk_1:** [06:15.03 - 06:28.75] Well,exactly,it was a marketing and it was,you know,obviously very effective because a number of public school systems have used in the past and still are using this in the talented and gifted.to stimulate creativity.

**spk_0:** [06:29.11 - 06:38.42] Well,for the benefit of our listeners who do not have any familiarity with Dungeons and Dragons,tell us something more about what is a cult about

**spk_1:** [06:38.42 - 07:32.30] it.What is a cult about it is in the game of Dungeons and Dragons,you will have various characters.These will be things like magic users,clerics.They can be unholy or holy.And in both of those character roles,both,both of those types of characters cast magic spells.Well,this sounds very innocuous and very innocent,but the tremendous amount of the spells in the printed literature in these books are authentic spells that are actually used.In addition to that,there's one whole book called Deities and Demigods,and now they call it Legends and Lore,and it says serving a god or a deity in advanced Dungeons and Dragons is a very important part of the game.And I can tell you that all the gods and deities in this book are authentic.Some people will call them occultic,some will call them mythological,but a number of these gods are still worshiped today by authentic occult religions.

**spk_0:** [07:32.86 - 07:43.62] And the children get to believing that the fantasy is very real is one of the problems with this,that the child mistakes the fantasy for reality.Well,

**spk_1:** [07:43.66 - 08:11.20] the problem is not only fantasy for reality,but when you put this much realistic material,it no longer becomes fantasy.And when the adolescents who are watching a lot of television shows see nothing but.occult supernatural powers which are allegedly have spiritual values and allegedly work,and they are beginning to do historical reading and they understand that many of these gods are authentic.All of them are authentic gods.It becomes an issue.

**spk_0:** [08:11.28 - 08:15.07] You mean authentic pagan gods who are worshiped at some time in history,

**spk_1:** [08:15.16 - 08:48.79] at some time in history,and currently are worshiped still today by certain people.And the point is,if you have an adolescent and you put this much reality in a game.That is real for some people.If these religions and these adolescents are learning,these religions are protected under the First Amendment are real,what is the difference in switching from their belief system or their god that they were brought up in their family to another belief system?So is this fantasy.Is it bringing reality to a situation for many kids?They're,they're not seeing it totally as fantasy.Well,

**spk_0:** [08:48.84 - 08:53.29] if it's not a board game,how do you advance from one point to the next in the game?

**spk_1:** [08:53.35 - 09:49.04] It's a role playing game and how you advance is the dungeon master creates a scenario.In which you will go on an imaginary quest,and he leads you through what would be an imaginary maze,and he creates obstacles,demons,devils,monsters,trapdoors,etc.for you to go through this imaginary world,and he talks about it,he talks you through this.And the object of the game is to gain as much power and wealth and stay alive as long as you can.Therefore,the game is a continuum.It doesn't end after you've played 2 or 3 hours.When you go through that particular scenario,that would be called a level 1 dungeon.The next level becomes each level becomes more increasingly difficult,and the obstacles and the adversaries that you must deal with in the imaginary realm become much more powerful and much more difficult.Therefore,you,you advance in degrees of difficulty.

**spk_0:** [09:49.40 - 09:53.23] Are the,are the young people sitting around in a circle talking about it?

**spk_1:** [09:53.45 - 10:24.11] They generally,it's advised that they sit around a table and they talk through this in the in in an imaginary kind of thing like play acting.The problem is with adolescents,many of the adolescents do not become satisfied just sitting around a table.This becomes very boring and they start wanting to actually role play.Physically role play,dress up in costumes,and this is where they start crossing some of the boundaries from fantasy to reality or from imagination to putting it into real practices.

**spk_0:** [10:24.40 - 10:28.96] Now you said the object of the game is to survive.What do you mean survive?Is somebody going to kill you?

**spk_1:** [10:29.12 - 10:54.86] Well,you will have many different obstacles that the dungeon master will create from the Uh,manuals called non-player characters such as demons,devils,monsters,etc.trapdoors,uh,trap chambers that you could become entrapped in or even killed,and you,your wit and cunning and a probability rolling a dice,which is called a probability dice of survival,is how you survive through this game.

**spk_0:** [10:55.71 - 11:00.60] Is the is the dice that they throw,is that like a poker dice or it's

**spk_1:** [11:00.60 - 11:11.54] a multi-sided dice,and it depends on what your character and what dice is called for for your character,what types of multi-sided dice your character will use.

**spk_0:** [11:12.16 - 11:14.07] Well,what about the violence in the game?

**spk_1:** [11:14.12 - 11:28.54] The violence in the game is another aspect that most people don't even think about when they talk about good versus evil in this.Game what it turns out to be because I played the game for 30 days myself to try and get a grip on what this game was all about.

**spk_0:** [11:28.76 - 11:31.60] Now was that the same game or was that a different game every day?

**spk_1:** [11:31.97 - 11:32.97] No,it was the same game,

**spk_0:** [11:33.10 - 11:35.98] the same game you played for 30 days,but it

**spk_1:** [11:35.98 - 12:43.45] was a continuum.See,you would play,we would play for 34 hours a day,and then we would continue and advance to the next level because my character never got killed off in the game.All right,all right,go ahead.So what we're talking about when they say good versus evil,it is a very amoral good versus evil.It is whatever is good for you to survive,whatever is good for you,and you can justify,uh,for example,anything in the name of the game just for your own self survival.And in addition to this,there are many different types of violence.That I don't know why the American psychiatric community hasn't gotten involved with this.There are 2 different forms,curses of insanity that a dungeon master can inflict on a player character,meaning to role play some of these forms of insanity.They range from sadomasochism to schizophrenia to homicidal mania to suicidal mania.They explain exactly what the form of insanity.is,and they tell you in 1 to 4 or 1 to 3 day intervals how you are supposed to have these maniacal urges to kill or to be killed or whatever.Now this

**spk_0:** [12:43.45 - 12:49.59] is the dungeon master telling the player what role he's supposed to play and how he's supposed to act.

**spk_1:** [12:49.72 - 12:55.98] No,actually,the player decides the role,but when it comes to things like curses,etc.the dungeon master inflicts those.

**spk_0:** [12:56.96 - 13:03.86] Ah,when you say you have to do anything in order to survive,you mean anything?You mean murder,robbery,whatever,murder,

**spk_1:** [13:04.08 - 13:17.81] robbery,maim,killing.They even have a character that is called,uh,an assassin character in the game.An assassin's primary duty is killing,obviously,and some of the assassins in the game are considered honorable.

**spk_0:** [13:18.81 - 13:21.66] Now that would be how many play at one time.

**spk_1:** [13:21.86 - 13:26.81] It depends.You generally have one dungeon master and two or more players.

**spk_0:** [13:27.01 - 13:30.14] Well,are they good and evil?Is one good and one evil?

**spk_1:** [13:30.41 - 13:44.76] Well,they can choose a good or an evil alignment.They have various alignments which are basically personality types,how they view the world.You can have lawful good.You can have a lawful evil,chaotic good,chaotic evil,neutral,etc.

**spk_0:** [13:45.08 - 13:47.34] A lawful according to the way you think about it.

**spk_1:** [13:47.57 - 14:29.42] Well,no,actually they tell you in the book what lawful evil is.Lawful evil means that they have a high regard for law and order,but they hold truth,ah,life,and beauty as valueless.That,that would be the way that you would choose that alignment.Now why would a teenager or anyone choose an evil alignment?The reason is,and most of the kids that have expressed it to me when I talk to them,most of them will tell you publicly when you get on these talk shows,Oh,I never play anything but good.Well,that's just not totally true.Most of the kids that I've been with and experienced in situations like this choose evil alignments.Why?Because evil has less restrictions on its character and has a better chance of survival.

**spk_0:** [14:29.63 - 14:32.11] Well,somebody has to be evil in it or you can't play the game,

**spk_1:** [14:32.23 - 14:38.74] right?Well,they all tell me when they We do some of these talk shows that they don't have evil characters in their game.They're only good.

**spk_0:** [14:39.12 - 14:41.63] Oh,and how long at one time do they play it?

**spk_1:** [14:41.88 - 14:51.97] It will vary.Generally,uh,in an average game they might play for 2 to 3 hours.They some will play for marathon games lasting 24,48 hours.

**spk_0:** [14:52.09 - 15:11.21] All right,well,Pat,stand by.We're going to break for a couple of announcements and we'll come back and talk more about your new book,The Devil's Web.We're talking with Pat Pulle and we'll invite your telephone to call at 1-8.736-32021800-736-3202.This is P Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_2:** [15:12.49 - 16:21.46] Child abuse in the classroom.You've heard callers on radio Live with Phyllis-Schlafly mention it many times.It is the best tool for explaining the changes that have occurred in education in the last 15 years.And contains actual testimony from parents,students,and educators given at 7 regional US Department of Education hearings.Over 200,000 copies of child abuse in the classroom have been sold.Read a copy yourself and give one to a friend.Or if you want to inform those who don't have time to read,buy the video tape which is narrated by Phyllis.The best way to alert your community to the problems in the public schools is to show this video to a group of your friends.Order your copy of Eagle Forum's Child Abuse in the Classroom,the book for 495,or the video for 2195.Write Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.That address again is Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.From the north to the south,we're standing proud.

**spk_0:** [16:23.39 - 18:11.84] The Black trees will shout the word about our Constitution is still standing.It's it's soaring high above the clouds.On the USA Radio Network,this is Philly Schlafly Live,and come on in because we're at 1-800-736-3202.We're talking about a fascinating game,but on the bad side of that,it's Dungeon Dungeons and Dragons with Pat Pulling.Again,1-800-736-3202.We're talking about Pat Pulling's new book called The Devil's Web,which is just out,and I.Hope is available at the Christian bookstores and other bookstores too.I don't see a price on it,Pat.How much is it?895.Well,it's,uh,fascinating.I,I read it yesterday.Let me ask you this question before we go to calls.Uh,suppose some of our listeners,uh,have fine families.They,uh,brought up their children to go to church on Sunday and respect their parents and,uh,believe in all that's good and true.Do you think they're safe from this type of seduction if they get dragged into a game like Dungeons and Dragons?

**spk_1:** [18:12.01 - 18:42.84] Well,I would say it's just like the drug culture.I don't think any child is totally safe from what goes on unless you raise them in a bubble.If you send them out into the world and they have experiences with other people,I think that you're,you're going to have to monitor and be very careful who their friends are and know what your children are doing.We can't just expect.Just because we think we've instilled certain values in our children that they are not going to fall under peer pressure and get involved with things that would be less than than like the family value system.

**spk_0:** [18:43.10 - 18:47.84] How many people nationally do you think are involved in Dungeons and Dragons?How many play the game?

**spk_1:** [18:47.98 - 18:57.51] Well,actually,how many physically are currently playing the game,I don't know.The manufacturer,uh,ranges in some of their media statistics from 3 to 4 million.

**spk_0:** [18:58.39 - 19:28.45] Well,let's go to our first call and see uh what kind of questions our listeners would like to ask you.Here's Mike in St.Louis over our flagship station KSIV.Hello Mike.What is your question?Hi,I have heard and read a lot about Dungeons and Dragons,but I was wondering,would your speaker have any idea how widespread it is in St.Louis?Uh,well,Pat,I don't know whether you know how widespread it is in St.Louis,uh,but you just gave us an answer nationally.Uh,do you have any other further comment on that?

**spk_1:** [19:28.54 - 20:07.91] Well,I certainly know that the game has been played in St.Louis because of one of the first murder cases I was ever involved in with Darren Molitor,a young man who killed a young woman.They were heavily involved in Dungeons and Dragons,and it seemed to be a fad back in 1984-198985.I don't know how heavily it's being played in the St.Louis school systems or if it is being played at the current time,and the only way we ever know that is when people call our office and say this is going on or that's going on.There's absolutely no way to monitor it because public school systems,each individual district has their own guidelines,and there's no central clearinghouse for what exactly everybody's doing.Pat and

**spk_0:** [20:07.91 - 20:20.65] Mike E can.Testify that it was really catching on big in 1980 and 198981 right here in Saint Louis.Uh,Pat,how many deaths do you think are attributable to Dungeons and Dragons?Well,

**spk_1:** [20:20.78 - 20:54.86] publicly,the last press release that Doctor Thomas Radecky of the National Coalition on TV Violence did,not just on Dungeons and Dragons,but on fantasy role playing games,many of which were Dungeons and Dragons.Were 125 related to fantasy role playing games,murders,and suicides.This was last April.Now that is what has been publicly released and when I say public.There are many other deaths on file.However,if it's a suicide of a juvenile and the parents or the family does not want this information released,then it cannot be released.And that

**spk_0:** [20:54.86 - 21:05.54] documentation is in Pat's book called The Devil's Web.Let's go to another call.And here's Andy in Green Bay,Wisconsin over WRVM.Hello,Andy,what is your question?Well,

**spk_3:** [21:05.58 - 22:10.27] I've got more of a statement.Uh,I've,I've played Dungeons and Dragons for several years.Uh,I'm a Christian now.And I learned it when I was in high school,and I belong to a group called the Society for Creative Anachronism.And for some of these people out there that may not believe that people take these games really seriously and go and live out the roles,I can tell you that there are very highly organized groups with thousands of members that get together to do just that kind of thing.Um,after I graduated from high school,I went back to that high school as a college student and taught 3rd to 12th graders twice a week in what they call the magnet arts program.It was,uh,an after-school program for teaching kids,uh,creative things related to arts and things of that nature.Uh,we had 20 to 25 kids in there and the local school was paying for it.Um,I was a dungeon master and I can tell you that everything that's being said here is just so true.It's so insidious.

**spk_0:** [22:12.04 - 22:16.98] Well,you felt that,uh,when it was all over,that you should not have done it,that it was not good.

**spk_3:** [22:17.36 - 22:42.16] Well,after I got saved in '86,I actually tried to go back and play and I couldn't.I went in thinking,well,I'll go and be a lawful,a lawful good character.I couldn't do it because I had to sit around and play with people who were making believe they were pagans,who were doing all these things which I would not as a Christian do.There's no room for it in Christianity whatsoever.

**spk_0:** [22:42.40 - 22:48.55] And well,a lot of isn't it true that a lot of the things they do are just plain wrong and illegal,whether you're a Christian or not?

**spk_3:** [22:48.72 - 23:18.57] Oh,absolutely.I remember going to a very large hotel for 3.5 days and playing one of those marathon games.We played for 72 hours.I was 17 years old and the drinking and the drug taking and the,the fooling around was just rampant.And this,the game itself was the catalyst to make all that stuff happen.You know,we centered around the game,but the activities that went with the game,you know,were just completely wrong.

**spk_0:** [23:19.23 - 23:24.45] Do you think that drugs lead into these fantasy role playing games,or it's the other way around?

**spk_3:** [23:24.75 - 23:51.08] I think they actually work quite well together.The The goal of this game,of course,is for maximum enjoyment and we would get very drunk and uh very wasted to,to increase the pleasure we,we would,we would receive.I remember as a dungeon master people trying to bribe me with uh bottles of booze and things of that nature.It just,it all went along with it,you know,hand in glove.

**spk_0:** [23:51.40 - 23:57.30] Well,thank you,Andy,for that firsthand experience,Pat.Do you have any comment on his,what he said?

**spk_1:** [23:57.48 - 24:34.98] Yes,I appreciate him calling and in defense of him getting involved many years ago,what I'd like to say is there are a number of young people who do go on to college.They are very intelligent.They've been involved in D&D for several years.It is an exciting game.And when they go to teach in the public school.Systems,I think many of them have been so desensitized they are not doing it to be vicious or or wrong or to hurt children.They're doing it because they have found so much pleasure in it themselves,and they are trying to give these children the pleasure,but we always know that not all,all things that give us pleasure is good for us.

**spk_0:** [24:35.15 - 24:38.12] And some people get addicted and and others don't.

**spk_1:** [24:38.51 - 24:44.79] Yes,and in my opinion,because the game is so complex,it's addictive by its very design,in my opinion.

**spk_0:** [24:45.31 - 25:21.46] Well,let's go to the next question.E and I in Trenton,New Jersey,WCHR for Phyllis Schlaffly and Pat Pulling.Hello,what is your question or comment?Um,I have a son which was,um,in Catholic school and he learned D&B.That was 1983,1984.And now he's still continuing to play this on himself at home.This is your son who's playing the game and he's,uh,still continuing even though he's out of school.Uh,well,Pat,do you have any recommendations for this mother?

**spk_1:** [25:22.03 - 25:43.69] Well,the,the only thing I can say is it doesn't mean because he's playing the game that he's going to go out and kill himself or someone else.The problem is I don't know how old your son is,but he must be growing up,and I would be a little more concerned with his,uh,obsession with staying in a fantasy world when he is still supposed to be growing up and advancing in life.

**spk_0:** [25:44.58 - 25:56.60] Well,thank you very much.Uh,let's go to the next question.Appreciate that.OK,very good.And we visit with Renee in Hamburg,Wisconsin over WRVM.Hello,Renee,what is your question or comment?

**spk_1:** [25:57.25 - 26:32.42] Those Dungeon and Dragon games,uh,they go on for months and more.Often than not,there is not a grown up in it.It's,uh,they make up their own,uh,games and rules and the longer they go,the more dangerous they become.And,um,if,if they haven't started using drugs,uh,they began to because um some of the freakish things

**spk_0:** [26:33.06 - 26:35.34] that,uh,they do.

**spk_1:** [26:36.27 - 26:51.56] Uh,and,uh,it,it,the behavior of the child at home becomes,uh,so,uh,outrageous that,um,and dangerous.

**spk_0:** [26:52.00 - 27:03.75] Well,thank you,Renee.Let's ask Pat,uh,if you could give our listeners any,any telltale signs of how they might be able to recognize if their children have gotten into Dungeons and Dragons.

**spk_1:** [27:04.00 - 28:06.98] Well.Telltale signs of not just the Dungeons and Dragons,but one of the things the caller said,this is not always the case,some of the signs are so subtle that they are not going to be obviously noticed.Some kids will get have bizarre or outrageous behavior.Some will have learned to role play so well that they will not exhibit this,this outrageous behavior.The best thing that parents can do to determine if their children are involved in anything of this violent nature.Uh,where it is taking hold of their life and it's becoming very dangerous is to note their drawings,their writings in their composition books.If they're writing poetry or essays or drawings about death,dying,dismemberment,they have a preoccupation with demonic type statements,demonic type gods such as Satan rules,I love Satan,etc.Then this is a child that obviously is obsessed with the dark side,the dark side of life,and there should be some intervention at least to get this child evaluated to see if they're homicidal or suicidal.

**spk_0:** [28:07.45 - 28:19.70] Those are some very good suggestions.Let's see if we can squeeze one more call in before the break.OK,let's stay with our affiliate in Wisconsin,WRVM,and here's Michelle.Hello,Michelle,have you got a quick question?Yes.

**spk_1:** [28:20.83 - 28:21.64] Um,

**spk_0:** [28:22.12 - 28:30.43] how many levels of Dungeons and Dragons are there exactly?Well,we'll ask our authority,Pat,how many levels of Dungeons and Dragons are there?

**spk_1:** [28:30.52 - 28:58.85] The levels are actually infinite,quite frankly.You can go one of the Dungeons and Dragons players that I knew quite well.went to like a 42nd level and he said his character became so powerful.It generally is around 1213,18 levels because they gain in power,but he said his character became so powerful that nothing in the game could destroy it,and he had to do what he called retire the character,put it on the shelf.And start all over again.

**spk_0:** [28:59.05 - 29:10.77] Well,thank you very much,Pat.We're going to have to break.Uh,please stand by and we'll be back shortly.1-800-736-3202.We will return to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_2:** [29:11.70 - 30:12.96] A national panel reported that 25% of 17-year-olds are functional illiterates.Another 40% are marginal illiterates.That means nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science.What have they been doing all those years in public schools?Sex education,death education,new age meditation,and other non-academic psychological activities.This can be stopped.US law gives you,the parents,primary control over your children's education.Find out about your rights.Read the Education Reporter.It's a monthly newspaper from Eagle-Forum.The education reporter keeps you informed about offensive school curricula and about victories won by parents who assert their rights.Write for a free sample of the education reporter.The address Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.

**spk_0:** [30:18.64 - 31:21.09] On the USA Radio Network.Welcome back to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.We're talking about the game Dungeons and Dragons with an authoritative source on it.Pat Pulling,come on in.Let's hear from you.Best time to jump in here is when you hear someone hang up.We're at 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-7.363202.We're talking to Pat Pulling,the author of a new book called The Devil's Web,which should be available in your local bookstores for 895.It's not just about Dungeons and Dragons.It's about all the people who are stalking your children for Satan,and she has some very interesting information about some of these.Famous occult murders of recent years such as the Son of Sam murders,the Charles Manson murders,and that,uh,poor pre-med student,uh,down near the border with Mexico.So Pat,you do go all around the country and talk to police investigators,and you've compiled an amazing amount of information.

**spk_1:** [31:21.39 - 31:40.41] Yes,that is true,and I also try to talk to the perpetrators as well because I find that a lot of times they are going to be your best source of learning how they got involved,why they got involved,and what,what,you know,what transpired and what type of transformation they took.Through their journey into some of the crimes they committed,

**spk_0:** [31:40.79 - 31:46.81] if parents suspect they have a child involved with any of these things,can they contact you?

**spk_1:** [31:47.10 - 32:06.39] They can certainly contact our organization.Um,our organization is listed in Richmond,Virginia.And we have a telephone number 804-264-0403.And there's also another good organization right in the Chicago area called Cult Awareness Network who has a lot of information.

**spk_0:** [32:06.51 - 32:09.59] And the name of your organization is DADD.

**spk_1:** [32:09.67 - 32:14.35] It stands for Bothered about D&D and Other Harmful Influences on Children.

**spk_0:** [32:14.85 - 32:26.67] Well,let's go to another call,Pat,and our first stop for this segment of Phyllis-Schlafly Live is Houston,Texas.Irma over KTEK.Hello,hello.What is your question or comment?

**spk_1:** [32:26.89 - 32:36.11] Well,I,I realized that this,uh,Dungeons and Dragons is satanic and,and,and occultic and everything,but what

**spk_0:** [32:36.21 - 32:37.43] actually does lead

**spk_1:** [32:37.43 - 32:39.55] to murder and suicide?What

**spk_0:** [32:40.09 - 32:52.86] motivates that?Uh,well,that's a good question,uh,Pat.Um,is it,uh,they're impelling the player to take a violent action or is it the putting of a spell on a player?

**spk_1:** [32:52.99 - 33:57.72] I would say it varies from case to case,but let's,let's take an example where you have 3 adolescents who go out and kill a convenience store clerk because they're acting out a role playing game.What happens in certain Situations is the kids again as I said,don't really take on totally the persona of the character that they're aware of,but what they do is they leave the game board,they go out,they want to get more hands on,and sometimes these types of things get out of control.They never had intentions of actually killing a human being,but it's like an escalating type thing when they get there,they're stalking.And it gets out of control.In some of the instances of suicide,there are various reasons why they do it.In some cases,the kids start over identifying with certain gods,and some of those gods or demons and devils that they get into what we might call self-styled Satanism,and they commit suicide.They give,make pacts with Lucifer,make pacts with the devil.And they commit suicide,as one stated in one of the suicide letters,to go to the bowels of the earth to be with his father.

**spk_0:** [33:58.12 - 34:01.62] And sometimes is it a spell that's put on him by the dungeon master?

**spk_1:** [34:01.88 - 34:25.47] Sometimes,but of course if you have a spell put on you,it would be,you know,it's very difficult for any logical thinking person.My goodness,this is just a game.Why would you or something in a fantasy world,why would you take it seriously?This is a process and that People go through and some people,if somebody put a spell on me,I'd tell them,forget it,it's not going to work and I'm not going to have anything to do with this.This is craziness.

**spk_0:** [34:25.64 - 34:27.88] Well,you have to be conditioned or brainwashed

**spk_1:** [34:28.30 - 34:54.04] conditioned,and you must think about situations like Jonestown where a cult type leader,not an old cult,but a cult type leader,demonstrated extreme control over his followers,and I think that's what you have to be very leery of in situations of role playing.Where the head leader may have a lot more control over the members of the group than you think,and that's where parents must monitor these kinds of situations.And most

**spk_0:** [34:54.04 - 34:56.75] of the members of the group are these young teenagers,

**spk_1:** [34:57.02 - 35:01.80] young teenagers,and sometimes,uh,elementary school,like 1112 years old.

**spk_0:** [35:02.00 - 35:10.06] Well,let's go to another call.Rich is standing by in Honolulu and listening to KLHT for Phyllis-Schlafly.Hello,Rich,what is your question?

**spk_4:** [35:11.29 - 35:35.16] Hi,uh,mine's not really a question.Mine is more like a comment.Um,uh,your co-host mentioned in 1980 and 198981 that,uh,I believe in the area that he was living in that it really was big.I'm 21 years old and in 1980 and 198981,I was in an intermediate school here in Honolulu,Hawaii,and it was really uh very big.Um,I got really wrapped into it.

**spk_0:** [35:35.62 - 35:37.46] Um,now what is it,Dungeons and Dragons?

**spk_4:** [35:37.86 - 35:52.16] Yes,yes.Um,I became a dungeon master.Um,right now I've got,I've got all my books laid out.I kept them for some reason,and I have no idea why,but I,I believe that this is probably one of the basic reasons so I can kinda.

**spk_0:** [35:52.81 - 35:56.72] So did you outgrow it or did you have a break or did you become disgusted with it or what?

**spk_4:** [35:58.01 - 36:45.40] I think a lot of it was outgrowing it,but I realized as that Christianity and uh Dungeons and Dragons do not go hand in hand.Just looking right here at the monster manual,uh,the first,uh,uh Uh,entrance underneath the devil is Asmodeus,and that's the arch devil.And there's,there's,uh,like,um,there's also the second one is Beelzebub who,who's mentioned in the Bible.I mean,there,I mean,there are a lot of characters here that are,uh,mentioned in the Bible,and there's,uh,I mean,it just goes through demons and,and,uh,devils and all kinds of things that I mean,people should really realize are wrong and are satanic in origin because I mean it,it,it truly says that some people,you know,uh,consider it.Uh,you know,

**spk_0:** [36:45.56 - 37:00.32] well,it seems to me that such things ought to be kept out of the public schools,if for no other reason than that they are a religion,for the same reason that other people's religion has been effectively kept out.Thank you,Rich.Pat,do you have any comment on our caller from Honolulu?

**spk_1:** [37:00.44 - 37:11.22] No,I think he made some very good points,and that's some of the authentic that's.Just a few excerpts of some of the the voluminous amount of authentic occult material that is in this particular game.

**spk_0:** [37:11.41 - 37:21.47] It is good to hear from people who have played the game.Let's go to another call.League City,Texas.We touched base with,and here's Bill for Phyllis.Hello,Bill,what is your question?I have a

**spk_4:** [37:21.47 - 37:52.13] comment about the Dungeons and Dragons.And it goes with playing the computer game.My whole family got involved with it.But,and it got wrapping up.Uh,we got wrapped up in it by getting stronger and stronger buying weapons and spells and potions,but,uh,thank God.We got out of it when we got saved.Well,

**spk_0:** [37:52.25 - 38:06.15] good.Well,thank you again.It's good to hear from somebody who's actually played the game.Shall we go to another call?Let's do it.Here's Todd in College Station,Texas over KAGZ.Hello Todd.Yes,what's your question?

**spk_5:** [38:06.65 - 38:43.76] Well,I'd like to make a statement.This whole program's been statements mostly,but I think that you're overrepresenting the,the killings and everything like that.I've been playing D&D for 10 years,and,well,I've gotten to more complex games than D&D within the past 5,and the people you're talking about in your program are essentially a lunatic fringe of a lunatic fringe.They're an extremely small portion of the population.In general,most people who play these games are intelligent enough to realize that they are only games and they are only stats on paper.

**spk_0:** [38:44.46 - 38:55.08] Well,if you think,uh,say there are 4 million people who play the game and only 125 deaths resulted,uh,it seems to me that still is a cause for concern.

**spk_5:** [38:55.58 - 39:10.32] Well,the question here is whether they actually stem from the game.I mean,the game could probably be a destabilizing factor for people who are already mentally unstable,but on the whole it cannot cause deaths by itself.

**spk_0:** [39:10.48 - 39:16.16] Well,at any rate,it seems it would have no place in the public school classroom.Pat,would you like to comment on that?Well,

**spk_1:** [39:16.20 - 40:13.74] I wish he had,you hadn't cut him off the line because he says that people are overreacting to the combat and violence and killing in this game.That's what this game is all about.It's combative situations.And if he's played D&D for 10 years and is saying that it isn't combative situations,then he is not telling the truth.Furthermore,the evidence couldn't be further from the truth that a lot of the even psychological autopsies in particular cases were done on the individuals.Some did have prior psychological problems and some did not,and some,it was stated this was the,uh,progressionary type of thing.And to also say that there are 3 to 4 million people playing the game that are healthy and not lunatics out there is an understatement.Certainly I would like to take a poll,a scientific study of everybody who's been playing this game and have them psychologically tested and see just where they fit in the spectrum of psychological well balance.

**spk_0:** [40:14.10 - 40:28.72] Well,thank you very much.Now if you'll stand by,Pat,we're going to take a break for a couple of announcements on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we're talking about Dungeons and Dragons and Pat's new book.We Will Continue.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [42:33.56 - 43:51.06] Welcome back to Phyllis-Schlafly Live on the USA Radio Network,and this is the program that puts you at the forefront of really what's happening in the public schools.We're talking about Dungeons and Dragons and still plenty of time for you to get in on this segment at 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-320.We're talking to Pat Pulla,whose new book called The Devil's Web is available now in your local bookstores.I urge you to get it.It's a gold mine of information about the occult and the temptations that are out there for your children.Pat,let me tell you about my first experience with Dungeons and Dragons.I was coming back on a plane from Washington one night,and the plane was crowded,and I sat on the aisle seat,and there were two young men in their late 20s sitting next to me.And they were talking in a in a just most agitated way and squirming around in their seats and back and forth and they they were talking English but I didn't understand one word they were saying.And this went on and it didn't stop.It was almost like they were possessed and I finally couldn't stand it and I said to one of the guys,what are you doing?And he said,we're playing Dungeons and Dragons.Uh,have you observed people playing this?Yes,

**spk_1:** [43:52.05 - 44:08.63] well,actually they are talking in game language and game terminology,so it doesn't sound,it is not certainly something that would be your average everyday language that anyone would understand.Uh,they're not talking in a foreign language.It's just game terminology.

**spk_0:** [44:09.57 - 45:28.50] Well,I,uh,I felt very nervous sitting next to them.It,it was,it was very peculiar or to use the,the word that teenagers use all the time.I would say it was weird.Did you have any interchange with them?No,none at all.They didn't want to talk to me.They were totally absorbed.They,they really even objected to my asking the question.Well,let's go to another call,Bruce.Very good.Here's Elaine in Saint Louis over KSIV.Hello,Elaine.What is your question or comment?Well,uh,most of us who,who've had children in gifted programs or who are honor students feel rather safe and smug,I guess,but I have noticed in some of the recent news reports of a lot of kids in gifted programs who seem to be pulled into this.Or maybe the school even sponsors it in gifted programs and even the connection.I,I wondered if there was any connection with crime.I noticed,um,uh,the young man in Kentucky who held students hostage was,uh,listed as being a,uh,a gifted or honor student.Is there any connection in all of that?And is it so that the gifted programs are being used like this?And secondly,Aren't there,since my children are grown,I really don't keep up with what's on television as far as cartoons,but aren't there Dungeons and Dragons cartoons and

**spk_1:** [45:28.50 - 45:28.61] so

**spk_0:** [45:28.61 - 45:28.84] on

**spk_1:** [45:28.86 - 45:29.64] on television?

**spk_0:** [45:29.77 - 45:31.80] Well,let's ask Pat to respond to that.

**spk_1:** [45:32.01 - 46:24.57] A few years ago there was certainly a Dungeons and Dragons cartoon.It may be in certain areas,but,uh,CBS used to carry it.CBS no longer carries it,and it's certainly not carried in our area,but it's not just Dungeons and Dragons.There's a tremendous amount of cartoons for young children.That have a tremendous amount of authentic occult material which desensitizes them to this type of thinking.You've got He-Man,She-Ram,Princess of Power.Uh,Voltron,many different Saturday morning cartoons put a certainly tremendous amount of authenticity in this,and obviously a 4 or 5 year old is not going to know what's authentic and what isn't,but as they grow up and go through the system,it is much easier to,uh,recruit or bring them into something like this because they are open to it.The symbology,etc.and the terminology is not strange or foreign to them.

**spk_0:** [46:25.25 - 46:49.48] In,uh,in Pat's book called The Devil's Web,there's quite a glossary in the back of occult terms,and they're very useful to those of us who are not deep into this and,and,uh,enable us,uh,they will enable us to recognize some of these terms.Uh,the questioner asked this question about the talented and gifted classes,and,and Pat,you have to be one of the smarter kids to get into,uh,these things,don't you?

**spk_1:** [46:49.81 - 47:25.62] Say into something like a role playing games,you would certainly have to be one of the smarter kids,but if you're talking about kids who get involved in quote devil worship or violent satanic rituals that some of the adolescents,these self-styled are getting into,no,they don't have to be the upper echelon of intelligence.Many of them develop a curiosity for many different reasons,some of which are certain types of heavy metal music,not all heavy metal,but certain types are indigenous.which are called black metal music to the black arts,Satanism,uh,human sacrifice,etc.Well,

**spk_0:** [47:25.66 - 47:41.57] if I had a child put in the talented and gifted classes,I would look very closely into what they're being taught.Let's go to another call.We haven't heard from our friends in Indianapolis over WXIR,but now they're here.Here's Brian Phyllis.Hello Brian.What is your question or comment?

**spk_7:** [47:41.78 - 48:54.20] Well,I just had a comment because I had played the game for about a year when I was in the Marine Corps overseas.And it was before I got saved.And,ah,but the game does,ah,has,has a like a deities and demons book that it goes into where you,you know,each character picks out a demon or a Or a God,you know,to,uh,go with your character,and,uh,I think one of the problems with the game was just idol worship.But,uh,I don't,I guess I've never been too much on psychology,but I think that,uh,One of the things about the game that,you know,people need to realize is that,uh,it does,it does work into your system,you know,you,you get to play it because I played way up into the morning,you know,and not want to quit before,and it's kind of a,I think it's kind of addictive.But I think the biggest problem with people that That don't know the Lord,they,uh,They're already lost anyway,you know,they're already going down.it's kind of like when they said,you know,that's what they do is sin.

**spk_0:** [48:54.74 - 49:12.46] Well,thanks a lot for your comment firsthand experience.Let's see if we can squeeze one more call in before the end.OK,it's back out to our affiliate in Wisconsin,WRVM,and here's Michelle for Pat Pulling and Phyllis-Schlafly.Hello,Michelle,have you got a quick question?Hi,um,

**spk_1:** [49:12.47 - 49:23.21] when and where exactly did Dungeons and Dragons first originate?Well,Pat,Geneva,Wisconsin,and it's still,that's where the game is made and they make many other fantasy role playing games.

**spk_0:** [49:23.62 - 49:36.36] Well,look out if you're in Wisconsin,but in the modern day and age it gets all over the country.And how about one more.Here's Gary in Midland,Texas over KKKK.Hello,Gary.Quick question or comment for you.

**spk_1:** [49:36.94 - 49:48.97] Yes,I've played the Lost City.It was the first and only one I've played,and it didn't seem that bad.I mean,I,I,I know that it's bad,but,

**spk_0:** [49:49.41 - 50:09.88] well,it doesn't affect all people the same way,and we're about out of time,aren't we,Bruce?Uh,we do thank Pat for joining us today.I urge you to get her book The Devil's Web.Uh,look for it in your local bookstore,and it'll give you all the documentation and be interested to get to your wrap up comments,Phyllis on the USA Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_2:** [50:10.65 - 52:14.55] Phonics.You've heard that phonics is the best proven method for teaching children to read.You've also heard that most schools have abandoned phonics or combined it with the less effective look,say,or whole language methods to help combat this problem.Eagle Forum's president P Phyllis Schlaffly,who taught her six children to read before she sent them to school,selected a program to help you teach your children to read at home.Eagle Forum's Head Start reading course is an intensive phonics reading program especially recommended for six year olds.Each set comes with a child's workbook,a teacher's book,and a McGuffey reader.Write Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002 and request information on the Head Start reading course today.Give your children a head start for life.Teach them how to read.Contact Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Videos,flyers,books,newsletters,cassettes,newspapers,all these and more are available to help you stay informed.Write Eagle-Forum and request a price list for a complete description of educational tools available to you.Eagle Forum's materials can help you make an impact on your community,your state,and your nation.Our information is the proven best tool to help you educate your friends on issues you care about child care,education,national defense,feminism,taxes,abortion,pornography,AIDS,the Constitution.elections,family,and foreign affairs.Eagle-Forum has educational materials that are specific,timely,important,and reliable.Write Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002 for a price list.Inform yourself and your community.Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_0:** [52:15.78 - 53:16.56] Sorry we couldn't get to any more calls for Pat Pulling,the author of Devil's Web,which is available in your local bookstore.It has a great deal of information on the occult and how it can tempt and attract your children,how it desensitizes them to violence,and we're particularly interested in this program on what is going.On in the schools,certainly none of this material belongs in the public schools,even as an extracurricular activity,because it is offensive to the religion of most of us.If you have a child in the talented and gifted classes,you should be particularly on guard against some of these programs in the classroom.Phyllis-Schlafly Live on parents' rights and education presented by the USA Radio Network and by Eagle-Forum,a leading pro-family organization since 1972.Stay informed on what the public schools are teaching our children with Phyllis-Schlafly Live on parents' rights and education.
