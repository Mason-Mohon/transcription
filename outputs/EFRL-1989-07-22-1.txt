**spk_0:** [00:00.83 - 00:12.32] About half the states have mandated teaching about AIDS in the public schools,sometimes in the early elementary grades.Do you know what is being taught in your schools about AIDS?

**spk_1:** [00:14.46 - 00:26.42] Welcome to Phyllis Schlaffly Live.I'm Bruce Hayes,and a little bit later on in the program,of course,we'll be going to your telephone calls.Phyllis,a new affiliate this week.It's KFIT in Austin,Texas.

**spk_0:** [00:26.61 - 00:28.74] Well,welcome,Austin.Definitely on

**spk_1:** [00:28.74 - 00:56.28] the move.Now to our matter at hand,acquired immune deficiency syndrome.You know,in his famous controversial report on AIDS,Dr.Everett Koop called for teaching children about AIDS in the early elementary grades.And I'm telling you that stirred up a storm of controversy and tarnished the prestige that Dr.Koop then enjoyed among conservative and pro-family people.Phyllis,where do we now stand on this issue of teaching about AIDS in the public schools?

**spk_0:** [00:56.40 - 01:58.51] It varies from state to state,but you have to say that the whole idea of teaching AIDS education in the schools is sweeping the country.According to a map we published in the Education Reporter,sometimes states just mandate the idea and leave it to the local school boards to fill in the particulars.At least 8 states have mandated the curriculum,and at least 9 states started in kindergarten,7 in grades 3 through 6,and a lot of others starting in grade 7.Uh,this is a very timely program because I noticed Doctor Coop was all over the TV last night.He was on several programs,but he did stay away from this subject of sex education,which he propelled into public debate a couple of years ago and became very controversial.Today we're going to talk with one concerned parent in one of the states where AIDS education was mandated,and I think that our listeners will get some ideas about how they can deal with this subject when it becomes an issue in their local areas.

**spk_1:** [01:58.71 - 02:10.28] And on the line,Mrs.Joan Kendall of Birmingham.Alabama,who worked with a group to be sure that the AIDS education taught was acceptable to Alabama parents.Are you there,Mrs.Kendall?

**spk_0:** [02:11.13 - 14:15.31] Hello,Joan.Please speak up into the microphone.I think what you did in Alabama is something that can be copied by parents in other parts of the country.So tell us how you first learned about AIDS education coming into the public schools and what you did.Well,uh,when the Alabama State Board of Education mandated AIDS education in the spring of 1987.Parents saw it as an opportunity for the schools to abandon uh timid teaching techniques and to take a strong stand for absent for abstinence from drug use and from sex outside of marriage,which of course is the only healthy behavior.Uh,for 9 long months,uh,to put it in a nutshell for you,we had meetings with health and education department officials,news conferences,public hearings.Citizens protest,letters to the editor,uh,we formed the Committee for accurate AIDS Education,which included an attorney,a pediatrician,a psychologist,PTO president,parents,and a physician with a subspecialty in infectious disease,and that committee,uh,was a very important thing to form and having.And now,now this committee,Joan,was all done by people who were not employees of the school system.In other words,this was a citizens' action group.Yes,put it together,but we did include people with expertise and having the attorney proved to be invaluable.And so,uh,when you formed your committee,did you approach the school directly?Um Well,we did several things.The,um,in June,the,the state health officer Earl Fox recommended two programs to the state board of education.Now,at our request,we we asked a clinical psychologist to review both programs.And in a written evaluation,he concluded that one of the programs could be revised to make it acceptable,but the other was totally unacceptable.And tell our listeners exactly why it was unacceptable.Well,the Yarborough program was unacceptable because it contained too little scientific information and too much values clarification.The other program,the SA program,um.Uh,had a,a couple of major difficulties,but it could have been revised to make it acceptable.Uh,one of the problems was that,uh,the information on condoms was insufficient and misleading.Now the author of the program agreed at our request to include a supplement on the difficulties with condoms,but this change was not accepted by Doctor Fox when we met with him.The other major problem with.Was that it contains the controversial surgeon General's report on AIDS which included the toll-free number of the National Gay Task Force AIDS hotline.That's the report on AIDS that came out,I believe,in 1987 and was received so much news.That's correct.And it included that report as part of the AIDS education program.That's correct.And as,as we wrote in a letter to Dr.Fox and to our governor Guy Hunt,we,we told him,and,and most people know this,that the Coop report was not designed for the public school classroom.It was,it was not.That's correct.It was designed for public education,but,but not public schools,right?It is,it is not appropriate for the students to read,study,and recite.Um,so what happened when you brought this out?Well,when the health department refused to delete even this hotline number from the curriculum,one parent represented herself as a curious fifteen-year-old and called the hotline number,and she transcribed the conversation and clearly,without question.The person on the other end of the line attempted to recruit the caller into homosexuality,no doubt about it.And what did you do with that information?Well,we held a press conference and we revealed that information and we sent the transcribed phone conversation to the state school board and um Also wrote in a cover letter,uh,that the parents of Alabama won't tolerate their tax dollars paying for such deductions and of course we mailed copies of this to all the press,um,the day before the Board of Education was to vote on this program.We received an overnight letter from an official in the in the public health department stating that he was now willing to exclude the surgeon General's report and to make the other requested changes we had asked for,but interestingly it was too late at that point to reverse.The public opinion because the next day the state board transferred the responsibility of producing the AIDS education plan from the health department back to the Department of Education.Did that give parents a better chance to work with the schools?Yes,it did very much so.The the department uh got right to work on their plan and in October their uh draft unit was made public,uh.Unfortunately,it contained dozens of confusing and inaccurate technical statements,and the entire philosophy of the program was really doomed to fail in the goal of promoting abstinence.But would you say that one of the principal objections to this curriculum curriculum,as well as others,is that it doesn't give a clear just say no message?No,it did not.The information on condoms was inaccurate.The purpose of the program was obscure and the approach was timid.And with the AIDS pandemic this is no time for for teachers to be timid.They need to give a strong stand and a clarion call,give all the compelling reasons.to sex and drugs.So what did your parents' committee do at this point?At that point we mailed the US Department of Education's booklet AIDS in the Education.That's the one put out by Secretary William Bennett.Yes,it was excellent.We mailed that to 130 superintendents in Alabama and urged them to examine the proposed draft curriculum in light of the department,the US Department's guidelines,and then to make their opinion known at the state level.In this way,did you have a lot of the teachers on your side?That certainly developed in the course of the 9 month period.And were you working with some of the clergy in Alabama?Not at that point.Um,it was at that point that the assistant superintendent of education invited us to meet with her and with the head of the writing team.Now this was really an open door for us.They were very receptive and responsive to us and ours.And uh I'm convinced it was because our concerns were so valid and our suggestions were so reasonable.At that time we presented a detailed analysis of the preliminary draft.You,you had no problem getting a copy of the curriculum,right?And,and so your committee went over it page by page,page by page,and we made numerous,numerous suggestions not only with the medical.Technical problems,but with the with the the philosophical approach to the problem.Did you find that the school personnel were agreeable to to hearing from you,or were they hostile at your interference with their work?No,they were,they were willing to listen to us,but I would remind listeners that we had laid the groundwork where at that time it was receiving publicity.I don't think they would have at that point been hostile to us at all.What was the grade level of this AIDS curriculum 7 through 12.Um-hum.And so,uh,were you successful in getting them to accommodate your changes?Well,uh,yes,we were very successful.They,they made significant revisions.One other thing the department did after we met with them was they decided to hold.Public hearings in 4 major cities in Alabama and at that point we contacted about 350 pastors in the state who in turn alerted others and encouraged them to attend these hearings and to speak.Were they attended well attended.We had mailed a packet excerpts from the programs.Every,every public hearing was very well attended.I asked Mrs.Kendall to be on the program this morning because I think this is such a good example of how parents can examine the curriculum,alert the public,uh,set up a committee,contact lots of people,and ultimately be very successful.Wouldn't you say that your efforts were crowned with success,Joan?We got about 9/10 of what we asked for,and without a doubt now Alabama children.will end up with a strong how and why to say no to sex and drugs.They made numerous,numerous changes.Well,tell me,did,uh,were you accused of trying to,uh,impose your values on other people's children,or were you accused of trying to bring religion into the course,which are two of the favorite arguments that are often used when parents try to speak up on this subject?No,we never were.Uh,every one of our suggestions and our position,was really indefensible,uh,because who could,who could object to extolling the only healthy behaviors.In regard to AIDS education,there was those accusations were never lodged against us.Have you detected any pressure to move the grade level down below the 7th grade?Yes,um,uh,interestingly,there has been another development in Alabama.The AIDS unit of instruction has now been incorporated into a comprehensive health curriculum.Now,yeah,uh,the,the integrity of the AIDS program is intact and it is there in the comprehensive health curriculum in its entirety,but they have included some AIDS education beginning at grade 4.I noticed that when Doctor Coop gave his original report,he called for explicit AIDS and sex education in the early elementary grades,and that was what was so offensive to many people that it created a great storm of protest,and that's why some of these schools have been going.After this type of education in the 2nd,3rd,or 4th grades,but I read an interview with,uh,Doctor Coop in the Village Voice,and,ah,which is kind of a left-wing newspaper in which he told how he had tried to talk to his 8-year-old grandson about sodomy,and he reported this himself.He said his 8-year-old grandson said gross and went on out to play.And I think the education that Dr.Koop got from his grandson might have made him back off from this effort to promote explicit teaching in the early elementary grades,which many parents think is highly objectionable.So,uh,I think you should be on your,on alert in Alabama that they don't try to lower the grade level.Many subjects and materials are age appropriate at of a later age,which are very offensive at an early age.Well,we have been assured that that is not going to take place.However,we are monitoring the situation because,as you say,how it translates into the classroom can be an entirely different matter.Well,thank you very much,Joan,for telling us,uh,what the parents did in Alabama.It's a good lesson for other parents in the rest of the country.Yes,I hope it will be.Joan,

**spk_0:** [18:27.57 - 26:25.68] Hello Sally,are you there?I think you had an encounter with AIDS education and sex education in the schools,didn't you?Well,tell us what happened.Well,it started out with a,uh,mandatory health book that I discovered that my children had to take in in high school in order to graduate,and in it.Uh,they were promoting homosexuality as an alternate lifestyle.You mean promoting it?They were promoting it,and,um,in fact,went so far as saying that more laws should be passed in order to protect homosexuals.And,um,did it say anything specifically about AIDS?It did,um,in in the 3rd edition of this particular book,and in it it said,quote,AIDS is technically not a sexually transmitted disease.And even went on to,uh,finally ask the students themselves,would you consider AIDS a sexually transmitted disease and asking them if they've heard of any recent information about AIDS.It was really almost a,a sick joke in a way of even putting it in the textbook.Well,that sounds like erroneous information in the textbook.Uh,is the textbook still in use?We were able to get the textbook out of the school system here in Seattle.And did you,um,uh,pursue the matter further on this whole area of of,uh,AIDS education that we're discussing today,right,because now it is mandatory,uh,in our state to for our students to receive AIDS education.So there has been,uh,is this,is this by state law,Sally?This is by state law,and we have a bill that was passed,uh,in our legislature here,and,um,they are supposed to be promoting abstinence.And we have been going through the curriculum.Our the state themselves here in Washington has made up their own curriculum and have entitled it N K N O W,as opposed to NO and um.Does that stand for anything?Well,I don't Maybe it means know,know about AIDS.Maybe it means know about AIDS.Well,that,but it's also know about a,a,a whole lot of other things,uh,going through this,um,the curriculum itself,um.I'm really appalled along with a lot of other parents as far as what they are teaching the children.Give us some examples.Well,the thing that that disturbed me right off is that this is mandatory from 5th grade on up,and in the 5th graders,and you're talking about children who are 10 and 11 years old,they have a glossary of terms,and,uh,in it they have sexual intercourse and not to offend anyone,but But mind you,this is what a 10 year old will,will be taught.Sexual intercourse is quote sexual union of two people involving the insertion of the penis and the vagina,the penis and the anus,or the genitals and the mouth,and I was just absolutely appalled.And this is in the book that's given to 10 year-olds.This is 1011 years old.This is for 5th and 6th graders,and this is just one small example.Of of the kind of information that our kids are learning about.Do you think the,the American people and the parents have any idea what is being taught under the subject called AIDS?I really don't believe so,not from what we have found.We go to presentations for parents.We do have,um,even though we have children who have graduated from the public school system here,we have 3 in elementary school,and Well,I'll bet at those presentations for parents nobody recited what you just recited.That's absolutely true.We are handed out materials and excerpts and that,but what we have found here is that what you need to do is to go either to the school district or up to your The school that your child is attending and ask to see the teacher's manual.In the teacher's manual is where you will find exactly what the teachers are allowed to teach your children and what and the types of people that they're allowed to bring into the classroom.Do you find that they will give parents access to the teacher's manual,or will they say that's confidential,the parents can't see it?No,we have actually found to our surprise that that they will give you the teacher's manual.As long as you understand you have every right in the world to see the teacher's manual,the,um,a lot of this information may not be presented in the student's textbook themselves,but,um,but it will be discussed in class because this is what the teacher has in her manual as far as teaching this particular class.Another thing that I think parents don't understand is the way so much of this classroom discussion is initiated by the children.So that the children may bring up subjects that,ah,the teacher or other children or their parents may not care to have discussed,but the children are directing the conversation.Do you find that is true?I,I really do.And in fact,by going through teachers manuals,you see that they really want the children and this is being done in in coed classes and you will see that,um,that the teachers are actually supposed to encourage.These,uh,questions to come out and to answer them as well as they can and if necessary bring in quote unquote experts from outside and they usually mention Planned Parenthood.Well,isn't your area the place where they had that TV program that went into a classroom and,ah,showed,um,a man describing everything with plastic models,right,right,and that was shown,ah,during family viewing time,uh,in our area here in Seattle,and,uh,and in fact this takes place in a,uh,sex education,uh,program here in a in a local high school and,uh,it,and it's unfortunately is not that uncommon in the teacher's manuals and in the material that we've gone through here in Seattle they actually tell the teachers to bring in Um,things such as zucchinis in order to,to have the,the children practice putting,uh,condoms on these zucchinis during class.Well,have your parents' groups been able to accomplish anything in dealing with the schools,or have you been running into a stone wall?We pretty much here run into pretty hard stone walls.It,it can be tackled,but the problem is that that the school system here and,and our particular school board here in Seattle.Has very liberal people on it and think that the more information that that children have,the better off they are.And,and our goal here has been educating individual parents and groups of parents exactly what is going on in the classroom.They are very shocked and they find it totally hard to believe,but when you show it to them in black and white,they have to accept it.And I have been real encouraged by seeing more and more people going up to the schools and really,um,demanding to see what is going on and how this is being handled,and that's been a real encouragement because it's not going to be just a particular group who's going to be able to really solve the mess that we're getting into with with all this AIDS education,but it's going to be just more or less a ground grass.Roots swell from from just all kinds of parents who are just totally appalled at this type of,of teaching,and I use that term loosely.Well,thank you very much,Sally,for being with us today.Uh,you've given some good encouragement to parents who want to do the same thing,and I hope you keep up with your educating parents so that they can know.Uh,we believe that parents and taxpayers ought to know exactly what is going on.in the public schools,Phyllis,

**spk_1:** [26:25.74 - 26:39.84] we have an information packet available on the acquired immune deficiency syndrome,and our listeners can send $10 and we'll pass out our address real shortly here on Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Let's work in a telephone call.We go out to Reno,Nevada.Here's Janine.

**spk_0:** [26:39.99 - 28:11.57] Hello,Janine.Good morning,Phyllis.Have you had some experience with AIDS education?Yes,we had a very good law before the AIDS hysteria hit us here.Which,uh,allowed each individual county to determine what kind of a sex education program they had.After the AIDS hysteria hit,uh,we were unable to stop the steamroller and the,the,uh,state mandated sex education in every county.However,parents can opt their children out.The problem is,is that most parents like this,uh,call,the caller before me said they aren't aware of what's going on in the classroom.And we worked very hard and our program which was adopted was modified from the original one,of course they wanted to start in kindergarten.It now doesn't start until 4th grade,which is In my opinion,much too early,but is it,is it mandatory?Is it mandatory in the 4th grade?It's mandatory in every school district,but a parent can opt their child out.Well,what do you feel about these opt out possibilities?Ah,parents don't know enough to opt them out,and there's such pressure from the children who don't want to be embarrassed in front of their friends by being opted out.Well,not only that,but we've had some problems here with,ah,children who,whose parents opt them out are actually being punished.Ah,they're,uh,required to do massive amounts of extra homework or they're required to do work that's very distasteful or unpleasant.They're sat out in the hall like on detention.We're out of time.Could you stand by after we have a,a break and some announcements?We'd like to come back to you.Certainly,

**spk_1:** [28:11.72 - 28:18.47] OK.And we would like to tell you that we will return and take your telephone calls next.Segment.This is Phyllis Schlaffly Live.

**spk_0:** [29:43.12 - 29:45.96] we hope to hear what age?That's another key.

**spk_1:** [29:46.73 - 30:08.12] Definitely,and we're at 1-800-736-3202.1-800-736-3202.A quick reminder that the opinions and views expressed on this program don't necessarily reflect the views or opinions of this station or its management.Let's move out to Saint Louis,and here's Bill over KSIV.

**spk_0:** [30:08.31 - 30:11.03] Hello Bill,do you have a comment on this subject?

**spk_4:** [30:11.38 - 30:42.88] Yes,I'm quite happy to see that they're teaching AIDS education in the public school.And for a very Christian reason and that maybe people will wake up and realize that you're not going to have morality and values taught anywhere without Christ and that to try to do this is an idolatry and a blasphemy.Ah,the worse that these public schools get,the more people are either going to have to come out and become true followers of Christ or to follow the public school into death and hell.Thank you.

**spk_0:** [30:43.28 - 31:02.49] Well,thank you for your opinion,and I think the caller does illustrate that you touch on the matter of values and what people believe very strongly.Ah,the public schools have to serve all the people,and at the very least they should not have courses that offend the religious values of,of,some of the people.Phyllis,here's Donna

**spk_1:** [31:02.49 - 31:02.93] in Dallas,

**spk_0:** [31:03.04 - 31:06.60] Texas.Hello,Donna,do you have some experience with AIDS education?

**spk_5:** [31:07.16 - 32:27.38] Well,hello,Phyllis.Ah,yes,I certainly do.Um,some time ago here in Dallas,some of us became concerned about what was being taught in our schools and particularly uh,what was being fed into them to the Dallas County Health Department,which is of course supported by taxpayers' money.So,uh,we went to a couple of commissioners we thought might be,uh,sympathetic to our point of view,and one of them put me on the review committee,uh,for the literature that comes out of the health department,and quite frankly,I was very upset over some of the things that I found.However,um,over the course of time I've been able to have a little bit of influence.Let me tell you,um,how it all started out.First of all,uh,a test was given,uh,to some students in the Dallas Independent School District,and of course the schools were not revealed,but The results were that,um,the children in the junior high schools were not very well trained,ah,about how to perform sexual intercourse and how to properly put on condoms,and a lot of the questions,uh,were geared to,uh,take away fears that may make them quote unquote homophobic.So this was a Definitely a signal to us that we needed to do something about it.

**spk_0:** [32:27.52 - 32:29.84] And what age pupils are you talking about?

**spk_5:** [32:30.31 - 32:31.59] 7th and 8th graders.

**spk_0:** [32:32.20 - 32:32.60] And so

**spk_5:** [32:32.60 - 32:35.80] you're talking about 13-year-olds,12-year-olds in some cases.

**spk_0:** [32:35.92 - 32:36.77] So what did you do?

**spk_5:** [32:37.12 - 33:06.06] Well,Uh,we went to the commissioners,as I said,and we said we don't know what we can do,uh,you know,the,the test is already taken.We see what,uh,the schools are planning to do because,uh,uh,not to my surprise,uh,the kids at the junior high level failed miserably to answer the questions on how to put on a condom and how to use other contraceptives.So anyway,I reviewed the literature.I've been working with the health department for quite some time,and I have,

**spk_0:** [33:06.51 - 33:10.99] well,did it ever occur to them that 13-year-olds didn't need that information?Well,

**spk_5:** [33:11.11 - 35:27.54] apparently not.They felt that they did,and we could see that the whole thrust of the sex education here in Dallas was going to be on training them just how to do it.So anyway,uh,in reviewing the literature,I also found quite a few things that disturbed me.For example,I have a little,uh,pamphlet here,uh,that may be in the schools now.I don't know,but it,uh,it shows that,uh,intercourse can be of three types,uh,vaginal,anal,and oral all on the same level.Now I don't think that's the kind of thing you should be,uh,teaching to young,young people in the junior high school.So what did you do about it?Well,I presented that to a county commissioner,and,um,he decided that he was going to make a little ruckus about it.And so this little particular pamphlet was,was withdrawn.Now the thing that I want to tell you about particularly though that disturbed me was a thing called the condom lineup game,and this,uh,was aimed at,uh,alternative schools.And when I checked to see what alternative schools were.Uh,I found that these were,uh,schools where abused children,foster children were placed,people who,children who had come from a bad environment and who already had,uh,you know,a pretty bad attitude,I'm sure about a lot of things involving sex.Well,the condom lineup games caused quite a furor,uh,of those on the the commissioner's court.Uh,each child was asked to hold up a card and stand in a line,and these cards would all be in different orders.And here are some of the things that the cards would say buy condoms,arousal,erections,hold tip of condom.I don't need to go on anyway,goes through about 12 of these steps,and then these children were supposed to line themselves up in the proper.Uh,order on how to,to do all these things.Well,this was taken out of the schools.Uh,everyone was appalled about it,but the point I'm trying to make is that the community can get involved,go to people who are,uh,in a position to do something about this.Offer your help.And they will be more than happy to put you on these committees where you can see what's going on and then you have a direct line to people who can do something about it,

**spk_0:** [35:27.70 - 36:13.99] I suppose that some of these people in the public health department get so wound up that they don't realize how off the wall their suggestions are.Donna,we had the public health department in Illinois that spent $450,000 of the Illinois taxpayers' money.They hired a group called Local Talent to write a song called The Condom Rag,and this skit was performed in the public plaza in the state capital of Illinois.Now our governor Thompson,who isn't any prude,said it's garbage.Everyone will think we are lunatics.And,ah,so I think when you bring some of these things out for public,ah,exposure that people,ah,can,ah,take action.

**spk_5:** [36:14.92 - 36:37.76] Well,you're absolutely right,Phyllis,and,and we found also that certain groups that had a particular interest in AIDS,uh,had already,uh,gone to the health department,and I'm talking about people from the Dallas Gay Alliance,uh,and their input seemed to be the only input that the authorities had for quite some time,and now we're working to counterbalance that,and I think we've had a real impact.Well,

**spk_0:** [36:37.88 - 36:41.91] do you think you've got an acceptable curriculum in the Dallas schools right now?No,

**spk_5:** [36:42.08 - 37:06.51] no.Not yet.Uh,we're,we're working on that,but at least the materials that are coming to the schools from the health department are being scrutinized,and we have noticed that,um,references to abstinence,uh,much less emphasis on the use of condoms,uh,a gradual change in that material.So we haven't been able to turn things around overnight,but we are having an impact,and,and we're very pleased to say that.

**spk_0:** [37:06.68 - 37:09.93] Well,have you developed a nice relationship with the school system?

**spk_5:** [37:10.37 - 37:12.35] Yes,we are very happy to

**spk_0:** [37:12.35 - 37:13.96] see.Do they think you're reasonable people.

**spk_5:** [37:14.59 - 37:42.85] We have,uh,not all of them.However,um,we are working in the campaigns of school board members,and we're delighted to say that the last person elected to the Dallas school board is a person who is in line with our thinking and who has been a prize.what we know about the sex education curriculum,and we feel very confident that he will work with us.And we're also working with the superintendent who seems to be a man who is sympathetic to our point of view.

**spk_0:** [37:43.13 - 37:51.93] Well,thank you very much for calling,Donna.I'll see if we can take a quick call from Sylvia before we go to announcements.She's in Arlington Heights,Illinois.Hello,Sylvia.

**spk_6:** [37:52.25 - 37:53.11] Hi Mrs.Schlaffly,

**spk_0:** [37:53.12 - 37:53.55] how are you?

**spk_6:** [37:54.46 - 38:56.84] Ah,Mrs.Schlafly,something happened at my,ah,son's high school.Um,I received a notice,ah,from the school district saying that,ah,all students who had not received AIDS education,um,would have to do so,ah,by for graduation,and they had a,uh,an hour and a half hour hour seminar on AIDS education,and there was this man from Chicago who came in and supposedly he was highly Ah,regarded by District 214 here in Arlington Heights,and so I decided that I would go with my tape recorder and so that I could tape and and refer back to certain statements that he might make,and,um,there were about 125 students present in the auditorium.And I positioned myself on the front row and I had my recorder right out there in front,and I was recording for about 5 minutes,and from the corner of my eye I could see that like 3 teachers were discussing something and then one of them came over and approached me and so Sylvia,

**spk_0:** [38:56.92 - 39:01.04] we have to stop for announcements.Can you stand by?Our listeners want to hear the end of this story.

**spk_1:** [39:01.63 - 40:10.58] Don't go away,Sylvia.On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.A national panel reported that 25% of 17-year-olds are functional illiterates.Another 40% are marginal illiterates.That means nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science.What then have they been doing all those years in public schools?Sex education,death education,new age meditation,and other non-academic psychological activities.This can be stopped.US Gives you the parents primary control over your children's education.Find out about your rights.Read the Education Reporter.It's a monthly newspaper from Eagle-Forum.The Education Reporter keeps you informed about offensive school curricula and about victories won by parents who assert their rights.Write for a free sample of the Education Reporter.The address Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [41:13.09 - 41:17.11] And on the USA Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and we were talking with

**spk_0:** [41:17.11 - 41:23.47] Sylvia.Yes,and you left us in suspense as you were tape recording the man on AIDS education,right?And then

**spk_6:** [41:23.47 - 44:33.29] one of the teachers approached me and said,Ma'am,will you please come over here?And I said,Surely,but I left my recorder running.And he said,I'd like to know who you are and what you're doing here.And I said,Well,I'm Sylvia Wagner,and I said,and I am a mother and a taxpayer,and that is why I am here.And he says,Well,I noticed that you're tape recording.And I said,Yes,I am.And he says,we would prefer that you not tape record.And I said,Well this is unheard of.I go all over the state to listen to different speakers,and I record,and I've never been asked not to record.And he said,Well,if you didn't have his permission,you can't proceed.And I said,Well,I'll tell you what I'll do.I'll keep recording and then at the end I'll ask him if it's OK.And if he says no,then I'll hand him the tape.And so the teacher said,OK,because see,I was strong enough,you know,that he started to back away.So I proceeded to tape and I could not believe what I was hearing at the,at the middle of his presentation.He said that homosexuality was.Not abnormal and that it's,uh,been going on since the beginning of time.And I wanted to interject at that point and tell him,well,so has murder,but just because murder has been around since the beginning of time,that does not make it normal.So,uh,he continued on and at the very end,he opens up a package of condom and he,they string down,you know,because they're all attached.And he says,OK,I want 6 volunteers.I want 3 girls,and I want 3 boys.And he says,Come on,guys,come on.And No one was volunteering,and he says,Come on,I need 3 guys.And no one was volunteering.He had to ask 4 times to get volunteers.Finally,he,he pointed to a young man and he says,Come on,I want you to come down here.And this young man then pulls his friend next to him,who pulls the next friend next to him.They come down to the front and then he says,OK,now I need 3 girls,3 volunteers.Again,the same story.It took him 4 times.Finally he got frustrated and he says,I can't believe that you kids.So uncomfortable about your bodies,he says,OK,if I can't get 3 girls,let's get 3 more boys.And none of the boys wanted to go,which is very unusual because usually high school guys want to show off.Well,they were all embarrassed,you know.So finally,when he couldn't even get 3 more boys,he finally picked a girl and he says,You come on down here.And then she got her girlfriend at the same time.Now he had all 5 of them lined up facing the rest of the students and then he says,All right,now I want you to open up these condoms,you know.A packages which they proceeded to do and then he inserted his hand into his condom and he waves to the to the kids with the condom covering his whole hand and he instructed the,you know,the other students to follow what he was doing.Well,the guys you could see were even embarrassed and they went ahead and they did it,but the girls just held the condom unopened between their thumb and their forefingers,and you could hear them going.And he again reiterated,I cannot believe how squeamish you people are and uncomfortable with your bodies.And then the bell rang,and then all of a sudden he started,this teacher got really hysterical and he starts to scream,Don't forget this.This is your future.Condoms are your future.Don't you ever forget this.

**spk_0:** [44:33.79 - 44:39.95] Well,I cannot believe what you're telling us.It's and this,this is education in the schools.This was in a high school.

**spk_6:** [44:40.07 - 44:40.91] This was in a high school.

**spk_0:** [44:41.02 - 44:46.52] Sounds like a circus.Well,thank you for sharing with us,Sylvia,and I hope you kept the tape and made use of it.Yes,

**spk_1:** [44:47.03 - 44:53.88] Phyllis,a little bit earlier we were talking with Janine about opting out of AIDS education,and she's back with us from Reno,Nevada.

**spk_0:** [44:54.09 - 46:16.52] Janine,thank you for calling back.Let's be quick because I've got another caller on the line I want to get to before the time is up.Well,we just mentioned some of the problems about opting out.Only opting out.What we really have to do is sign the children to be in the classes.However,there's been Numerous times that that's been a fraudulent note signed by the students themselves.We only have about 4% of the students opting out statewide,which is a real concern because of the program.I might just mention that in our seventh grade,well,it's very embarrassing for the child to opt out.Well,they're ridiculed,but also they're punished by the,uh,by the teachers.One student was whose mother opted him out.In fact,she had run for school board.Um,when he opted out,uh,the teacher assigned him to outline the entire health book.When the mother found out,she totally refused and yanked him out of the class,but they're continually,um,punished,ridiculed,and harassed because they are not taking the classes.So it makes it really hard for people.Who want to try to take their kids out of the class.Well,the only solution to this,I think,is for more parents to be concerned and to stand together.And if half the class opts out,then you would have a different psychological situation in the class.That's right,and I think we're,uh,able to do that more and more as we.Expose what's going on.For instance,in the Janine,I think we'll have to cut off at this point.We want to try to get one more caller in on this program.So thank you very much for calling.

**spk_1:** [46:16.68 - 46:20.62] And we take you out to the nation's capital and for Philly Schlaffly,here's Jean.

**spk_0:** [46:20.74 - 48:25.48] Hello Jean.Yes,it's good to be with you from Washington DC Uh,do you have some experience with what's going on in the schools on this subject?Yeah,I have.I first of all,uh,your book,uh,Child Abuse in the Classroom is the classic work on the kind of debauchery education which is going on.It doesn't mention AIDS.It came out before I knew about AIDS.Well,it applies.Everything in there.Uh,they're all the same techniques.Oh yeah,the same techniques,the same,uh,breakdown of.Of,uh,decency and so forth.I will say this on a,on a very positive note,uh,I,I'm,uh,although I'm a native New Yorker,I,I live in Texas,and,uh,under our state law now,every piece of AIDS education which is produced by the state must state that homosexual conduct is illegal,which it is because we have an anti-sodomy law.It and it is a criminal act,and it is unacceptable behavior,so every young person.That gets any kind of literature produced by the state,ah,this has to state that,and,ah,it cannot condone it.We have very explicit language saying that it cannot condone homosexual conduct.Well,that may be the law,but I would suggest that parents read what materials are being used because we find in a lot of areas on this subject the law is not being obeyed.No doubt.I'm just trying to say that at least we,we gave parents recourse.Ah,to,to do that,uh,I will say,you know,there are any number of horror stories.Uh,what they're doing in Canada now,you know,which,which is they're headed for,for the US,is they have a role play in which you are the only heterosexual in a class of homosexuals.Everybody else is a homosexual,and you just are starting to realize that you don't like people of the same sex.You like people.Opposite sex and you feel alone and you feel isolated and you feel lonely and unhappy and sad and then one day you see a poster saying,you know,heterosexual students come out of the closet.We're out of time,Gene.Thank you very much for calling in.Role playing is one of those psychological techniques which parents find very objectionable.
