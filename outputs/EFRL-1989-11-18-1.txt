**spk_0:** [00:00.76 - 00:06.27] Religion and traditional values,do they tell the truth,or have those values been censored out?

**spk_1:** [00:07.76 - 00:49.94] Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Another hour of interesting conversation to come your way and come on in right now because we want to get those callers lined up at 1-800-736-3202.Since we're coming up on Thanksgiving next week,that's our uniquely American holiday,we have a guest who's an expert on how public school textbooks treat our religious heritage and how they don't.Treated.Our guest today is Professor Paul C.Vitz,who several years ago received a grant from the National Institute of Education to make a landmark study of how religion and traditional values are portrayed in our nation's textbooks.

**spk_0:** [00:50.03 - 01:24.93] We're so happy that Doctor Vitz of New York University will visit with us today from his office in New York City.Doctor Vitz is a gold mine of information on this subject.Since he and his team read a whole series of readers and social studies and world history textbooks which are used in the public schools from grades 1 through 12,dozens of them,and his conclusions are based on firsthand knowledge of what is being taught.Besides,as a scholar in these fields,he's eminently qualified to say what should be taught and to point out what has been systematically omitted.Well,

**spk_1:** [01:25.05 - 01:40.11] we have the lines opened up right now and we will be going to those calls in the second segment,but we invite you to join us right now at 1-800-736-3202.And here.Dr.Paul Vitz on the line with us from New York City.

**spk_0:** [01:40.31 - 02:06.13] Hello,Dr.Vitz.Phyllis.Thank you for joining us today.Well,it's a pleasure.Well,let's,let's start out with what is probably the most famous line in this study that you made a couple of years ago,and that is that you found that the elementary social studies textbooks told the students about Thanksgiving.But they didn't explain to whom the pilgrims gave thanks.That's right.Would you like to tell us about that in your own words?

**spk_2:** [02:06.33 - 02:26.47] Well,of course it varied a little bit from book to book,but not a lot,and some books were so bad as to have,say,30 pages on the pilgrims,30 pages on their first year here,which would end with Thanksgiving.And not have a single reference in word or in a picture to religion in the life of the pilgrims.

**spk_0:** [02:26.79 - 02:38.97] Religion just,they didn't tell that religion was important to the pilgrims.No,they didn't.They just told that pilgrims are people who like to make long trips and come over on the Mayflower and come to the New World.

**spk_2:** [02:39.31 - 02:56.07] Yes,it was never clear why they came over here in that book,and I found the same 30 pages reprinted in another publisher with another publishing title,but it was the same.30 pages in which pilgrims were defined as people who make long trips.I always thought that was tourists,

**spk_0:** [02:56.39 - 03:13.20] right?Give us some more examples of what you found that was omitted in these elementary and secondary school textbooks about our religious heritage,about important religious events of our heritage or attitudes of the American people.

**spk_2:** [03:13.59 - 04:04.93] Well,first of all,the books in social studies that we're talking about now.are supposed to introduce the child to American life today,sort of what's going on today,something about,ah,you know,social and political and economic life,and then a little bit about American history.That is,the books that I looked at were grades 1 through 6,and occasionally they mentioned,uh,religion in the life of Americans in the past,but even then it wasn't very often,and it was always,you know,more or less at least 100 and usually 200 years ago.But they never mentioned anything about,um,serious or about any kind of actual religious behavior in life today in America.That is,no word ever referred to anyone who went to church or prayed or did anything related to,ah,actually.Doing something religious today.

**spk_0:** [04:05.21 - 04:16.33] Well,don't you think that if you look at the,the whole world and comparative cultures around the world that the United States is really a very religious nation?

**spk_2:** [04:16.73 - 04:35.51] Absolutely.I would say at least in the Western world,we're probably the most religious nation,although there might be some competition from Poland or Ireland,and of course many of the third world countries are quite religious,but We're probably the most religious of all the modern and Western nations,and they never mentioned this.

**spk_0:** [04:35.81 - 04:38.75] The child wouldn't learn that at all from the textbooks.Absolutely.

**spk_2:** [04:38.89 - 04:43.65] In fact,they'd probably learn that religion,since it wasn't mentioned,isn't important,

**spk_0:** [04:43.97 - 04:50.45] or that it was just something that happened many decades ago back in the olden days with a lot of those other myths,right,

**spk_2:** [04:50.73 - 05:03.26] right.That was one of the other themes that I think was being suggested that.In the days of the Pilgrims or perhaps in the Spanish missions or,you know,the Amish who still live like that,so to speak,

**spk_0:** [05:03.48 - 05:06.80] some strange people,even some strange people would be religious,is that

**spk_2:** [05:06.80 - 05:10.36] it?That's right.That's right,strange and old fashioned.Well,

**spk_0:** [05:10.44 - 05:22.62] you and I have lived very recently through the two administrations of Ronald Reagan,and,and he was a man who frequently talked about God and the importance of religion in our life.You wouldn't find that in the textbooks.

**spk_2:** [05:22.74 - 05:24.32] No,you wouldn't.You wouldn't find it.

**spk_0:** [05:24.61 - 05:32.60] Give us some more examples of some of the evidences of our religious heritage that you found censored out.

**spk_2:** [05:33.06 - 06:46.52] Well,there were no exams,no references in these books or in the high school history books to very,to a large number of important events in American life,such as,well,I mean,no religious events such as the First Great Awakening,the Second Great Awakening,those would never be mentioned.Um,they are actually,of course,religious events.Catholics were mentioned very rarely,and then again it would be only with the missions in the Southwest or something like that.Occasionally a little bit would be mentioned,maybe a line or two about prejudice against Catholics,but Catholics never did anything good for the country.And the people who were most left out,much to my surprise,were the evangelical and fundamental fundamentalist Protestants.I couldn't believe it,but there wasn't a reference,ah,anywhere in these books to,ah,serious committed Protestantism in the present or even to where the people who are so influential in our country today,who are fundamentalists or evangelical,where they came from in the past.I mean they,they didn't have anything about their whole world,which is with us as an important fact,and they don't have anything in there about where they came from.

**spk_0:** [06:47.32 - 07:04.18] Well,what about the building of all of the religious schools?There's a whole network of Catholic schools.There's a whole network of Christian Protestant schools.Uh,do they exist in any of these descriptions of 20th century culture?

**spk_2:** [07:04.65 - 07:34.27] They were not mentioned once in any way whatsoever in any of the social studies textbooks.They were never referred to in any of the English readers that I read,and in the high school American history books,which averaged,you know,700 pages or something like that and had a lot of often fairly trivial information,but they had much more information than the grade school books,there was not one reference to the,to the,to anything besides,I mean,to any religious school.

**spk_0:** [07:34.90 - 08:41.38] I think I found one reason for that when I read the resolutions passed by the National Education Association at its big convention in Washington this year where I think they had about 9000 delegates,and these resolutions show enormous animosity of the NEA against any kind of private schools.And not only are they adamantly opposed to any type.Type of tax credits or vouchers to assist people uh parents with paying the cost of sending their children to the other schools,but the NEA has a resolution saying that it opposes renting or selling of closed public school buildings to any private schools,and the NEA is very frank about its reason.It says it wants to.Keep out of the community any institution in direct competition with public schools.So I would say that censoring out of the social studies textbooks,the fact that these schools exist,would go along with that frame of mind.

**spk_2:** [08:41.70 - 09:02.31] Absolutely it's just the monopoly trying to keep everybody ignorant that there's any alternative to them,and it's a classic case of leaving out the competition.And then they go around and say they're educating people,that they're telling them the truth and giving them the historical facts.Well,of course,that's just a big fraud.

**spk_0:** [09:02.81 - 09:17.05] Well,tell us what they say about important people when they select out a handful of the people who've lived in the 20th century as important people to be referenced in these books,um,who do they pick?

**spk_2:** [09:17.78 - 09:56.30] Well,it was really kind of interesting to me.I noticed this sort of,ah,it was so strong.I noticed it when I was actually concerned mostly with religion,and so I stopped and,ah,measured it.Ah,one of the important things about social studies textbooks is that they're kind of disorder disordered and fragmented,and so they,they,that is,they're not really systematic introductions to knowledge of any kind.And I can say this,that although they badly treated religion,mostly by leaving it out,ah,they're,they're just incompetent textbooks.They're really the best example of the dumbed down phenomenon that I've ever seen.

**spk_0:** [09:56.47 - 09:58.23] Are they chronologically arranged?

**spk_2:** [09:58.66 - 10:24.29] Ah,not even reliably that way.Ah,they skip around a lot.Sometimes they're,ah,the world history or world culture,they'll jump around chronologically in a very mixed way so that you couldn't have any understanding of history as a timeline.But let's get back to that question of who do they pick for special emphasis.Well,these people are usually given a,a separate page sort of inserted in the middle of the,the text

**spk_0:** [10:24.29 - 10:26.13] like a box in the newspaper,

**spk_2:** [10:26.30 - 11:37.27] or often a whole page with a photograph of them and then a paragraph or two beneath.And these people are what educators call role models.They're trying,you know,they're putting in there people who will serve as role models for the kids.And what I looked at were those that were selected as role models who had been,ah,active in American life since World War II,that's roughly the last 40 years or so,and those who had any social or political significance.In other words,I left out scientists.And artists and um.People of that type who had some kind of special contribution,although even there there was something of a pattern,but I just looked at those who had a significance,if you will,of a political kind or of a social kind,ah,and just Recorded who they were.Well,who were they?Well,Let me get,let me look at my chart myself.I can tell you right now that when I kept track of all these people,they were,they were 1 or 222 different types.

**spk_0:** [11:37.38 - 11:41.82] Yeah,they were giving good conservative leaders like Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater,I suppose.

**spk_2:** [11:43.94 - 12:05.01] Well,not at all.Um,in fact,of those that I looked at,I think about,um,I guess I'd say about 19 out of 21 or 22 were Democrats.And known to be such,uh,the people that they picked were people like,well,I could just read the list.

**spk_0:** [12:05.60 - 12:06.97] Oh go ahead,go ahead,we'd like to hear it.

**spk_2:** [12:07.09 - 12:38.20] OK,Herman Badillo,New York City politician.Romana Beuelas,these are both,she's a Democrat,treasurer of the US.Thomas Bradley,mayor of,um,Los Angeles,he was in there twice.Rachel Carson and the ecology movement twice.Ah,Martin Luther King,not surprising,3 times.Uh,Margaret Mead,I listed my book as in there 2 times,but I later discovered I missed one,so she was in there 3 times.Margaret Mead.

**spk_0:** [12:38.36 - 12:45.07] Well,she had a powerful influence in this country in,in promoting,um,sexual permissiveness.

**spk_2:** [12:45.28 - 13:35.78] Absolutely.She was the first one to sort of start it with that work of hers on Samoa that's now been thoroughly discredited by other anthropologists.But so we have Eleanor Roosevelt 3 times,uh,Coleman Young,Dixie Lee Ray.Julian Nava,Patsy Minkk,uh,Thurgood Marshall,Maggie Coon,the Great Panthers and feminist,Nancy Cassebaum,uh,she's the first Republican we've gotten,and she's sort of middle of the road.Dolores Huerta,uh,Of the US United Farm Workers,uh,Patricia Harris,Ella Grasso,Millicent Fenwick,uh,Vine DeLaurea,Henry Cisneros,Raul Castro.Ralph Bunch,and that's the list of names.

**spk_0:** [13:36.23 - 13:49.19] It sounds like a bunch of left wingers to me.It sounds like the kind of people who'd be invited to speak at a meeting of the Democratic National Convention or the National Education Association or the American Civil Liberties Union.

**spk_2:** [13:49.33 - 14:15.46] Absolutely,that's who they are.The only exceptions were Claire Booth Luz,who was mentioned once,once,but of course she's no longer alive.Uh,Nancy Casenbaum,I guess she's a fairly liberal Republican senator,and Millicent Fenwick,who's a representative in US Congress,also,I think she was Republican and so on,but she was a feminist and a feminist

**spk_0:** [14:15.46 - 14:17.86] and considered to be one of the liberal Republicans,

**spk_2:** [14:17.98 - 14:32.91] right?So no,except for Claire Booth Lewis,who's quite out of date,there's not a single conservative figure here.And even more interesting,there's certainly nobody approaching a conservative male Republican on the list,and all the rest.

**spk_0:** [14:33.03 - 14:40.01] Well,well,these,these textbooks are fairly.They're,they're in current publication.They ought to have current people.

**spk_2:** [14:40.69 - 14:50.84] Well,yes,these are all textbooks.In fact,these are textbooks that were published between about 1980 and 1980.83.I did the study in in 83 to 85.

**spk_0:** [14:50.92 - 14:52.34] All right,well stand by.

**spk_1:** [14:52.69 - 15:03.23] Professor Vitz.We're going to continue our discussion and we'll look forward to hearing from you at 1-800-736-3202.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_0:** [17:24.56 - 17:49.95] Before we go to calls,Doctor Vitz,I want to finish up this thought we were in the middle of when we had to break.And that is the the selections of uh people or role models who have special pictures in these social studies textbooks.Let me ask you,do they show any of the businessmen who have done so much to uh develop uh the economic recovery in this country and to expand jobs?

**spk_2:** [17:50.30 - 18:18.12] None.They don't have any reference even to the phenomenon.Business hardly exists as far as these books are concerned and certainly not.In terms of a dramatic and exciting and very important,ah,social phenomenon,it's not there,and none of the great businessmen.At least since World War II,are there,but of them had,you know,a few of them would have maybe Henry Ford once or something like that.But since World War II there was,there were no businessmen.But look

**spk_0:** [18:18.12 - 18:28.16] at the way computers have changed our lives and how this whole new industry,which has been so influential,developed in the climate of freedom in our country.

**spk_2:** [18:28.44 - 18:55.99] Absolutely.And something like Silicon Valley and many of the other new businesses that have come on in the last 20 years.are extremely important,uh,for our country,uh,not only economically but in many other ways,and there was no reference to any of these people,and I was surprised they didn't have some of the great,uh,successful businessmen in the last 20 years who are immigrants like,uh,Mister Wang,who founded Wang Computers up in the Boston area,and there are others,but they had nothing on this.

**spk_0:** [18:56.71 - 19:01.43] Well,let's take some calls and see what people would like to ask you since our board's already lit up.

**spk_1:** [19:01.75 - 19:06.66] Terrific.Very good.Our first stop is St.Louis over KSIV.Here's Ron.

**spk_0:** [19:06.79 - 20:02.59] Hello,Ron.Uh,do you have a question or comment for Dr.Vitz?Oh,I have a comment that he might want to do.Could you talk up a little louder?I'm having trouble hearing you.OK.You might want to do a little research into this one.I attended a residential facility for the blind in St.Louis,Missouri.And we were not even allowed to even have Bibles on the state property.But yet the folks can have the Braille edition of Playboy and other such magazines.I always find that very bizarre.I'm having trouble hearing you.Did you say they had Playboy in the schools?Right.What I was saying was,let me switch phones.Is that better?Yeah,that's a little better.OK.What I was saying was that we couldn't have Bibles on the state property,but yet the folks could have a Playboy magazine.And one of our students even had his Bibles boxed up and shipped home.His mom sent them back.They sent them back all year.They went through this.Well,well,uh,thank you for pointing out the double standards of the people who yap about censorship.

**spk_2:** [20:02.87 - 20:38.94] Absolutely.I mean,this was,he was talking about a school for the blind in Missouri and Braille editions of the Bible were excluded while I gather Braille editions of Playboy or something equivalent,maybe,tape recordings or something of that kind were allowed in.And the idea that this is not bias in favor of anti-religious and in particular anti-Christian material is simply false,and the government programs and the government money is being used to systematically exclude religion,especially Christianity,and to systematically support things which are opposed to it.

**spk_0:** [20:39.39 - 20:47.28] And when people like this caller object to having Playboy paid for by taxpayers' money,they are accused of censorship.

**spk_2:** [20:47.44 - 20:55.16] That's right,they're accused of censorship,but of course the big censorship is that the great book of the world,the Bible,is explicitly excluded,

**spk_0:** [20:55.44 - 21:06.83] as you say so well in your book,and I'll give our listeners the title.Of your book on these matters which is called Censorship Evidence of Bias in Our Children's Textbooks,

**spk_1:** [21:06.84 - 21:12.66] and we move on to Oshkosh,Wisconsin,and it's Craig over at WRVS.Hello,

**spk_0:** [21:12.73 - 21:14.52] Craig,what is your question or comment?

**spk_1:** [21:14.79 - 21:16.92] Oh hellos.I got a comment.OK,

**spk_0:** [21:16.96 - 22:05.78] I looked at our new history book here in town in our school system.And they're making reference uh about our United States history coming after the Revolution War onwards,but there's no mention of the Columbus coming over,no mention of the Pilgrims,no mention of anything else in the past.It's like they're wiping it out.They don't even tell you Columbus came to America.No.How do they think we got here?That's a good question.I went back to my old high school,uh,history book,and it does make a mention Columbus was here,the French Indian War,Boston Tea Party,uh,Declaration of Independence,and the Constitution.But the new history book doesn't teach it.Well,let's ask Dr.Vitz what he thinks about that and even those textbooks that do mention Columbus,Doctor Vitz,um,I'll bet they don't tell that Columbus came to the New World to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.

**spk_2:** [22:05.99 - 22:43.09] No,they don't.Uh,the closest the text will get to it is occasionally they'll have a picture with one of the flags with,you know,the Nina or the Pinto or the Santa Maria.That Santa,what Santa Maria means,of course they'd never mention,but with,um,with a cross on the,uh,on the sails,or occasionally there'll be a picture of Columbus Landing in which one of the,um,members of the party is a priest who's,ah,let's say,kneeling or in some other way,ah,showing a Christian visual symbol.But in general,they would never mention anything like that and I never came across it.

**spk_0:** [22:44.08 - 23:04.38] Um,my,my great hero is George Washington and it does seem to me that that George Washington is definitely being downplayed.We don't have Washington's birthday anymore.We have the president's birthday.And I can think of a lot of presidents whose birthdays I don't care to observe,uh,but what,how is,uh,how is Washington treated in,of course they have to talk about Washington,

**spk_2:** [23:04.93 - 23:18.23] of course,whenever they deal with the Revolutionary War,but they almost never talk about any of his comments about religion and the importance of it,such as in his.And particularly I think his second inaugural address and

**spk_0:** [23:18.58 - 23:36.39] oh,there's so many fine quotations from George Washington about the importance of religious and morality in public life and his saying that he never could have survived the Revolutionary War without divine Providence helping and there's just so many quotations.Do any of those show up in the social studies?

**spk_2:** [23:37.07 - 25:25.66] That's the kind of thing they leave out.I mean,they're so worried.I mean,I'll give you an example.Of how bad it gets.I mean,it was unbelievable to me when I finally found this and wondered about it.But there's a very,ah,well-known Jewish writer named Isaac Bashevis Singer.Now he received the Nobel Prize for his work as a writer,and he was especially famous for writing short stories about Jewish life 100 years ago in Eastern Europe,Poland,Russia,and places like that.The world he was describing was sort of the world that you would find in a musical like Fiddler on the Roof.Now,he had a short story called Zlata the Goat that was reprinted in the 6th grade reader of a major publisher here in New York.And it was listed,you know,Isaac Bashevis Singer,Zlata the goat,and it was a short story,so it was only,uh,7 pages or something like that,maybe a little shorter even.That's it was a very short,nice little story about this boy.And uh,I read it and,um,before I had,I mean,I finished the study,but,but it was after that that I began to reflect on what I had read and I became a little suspicious.So one day going through the NYU library,I stopped and got out the,the Isaac Bashevis Singer collection and read the original.In it,since it's only 7 pages,it was easy to read and to compare word for word with the reprinted story in the reader,and the reprinted story was identical with the,uh,with the original.Except for 3 words,3 words in the entire text were deleted.

**spk_0:** [25:27.55 - 25:28.20] And what were they?

**spk_2:** [25:28.37 - 25:36.61] Those three words were God.God and God.Unbelievable to me.These,

**spk_0:** [25:39.73 - 25:50.32] these are the people who say they're against censorship,but they are actually censoring words out of a Nobel Prize winning author's story before they give it to the schoolchildren,

**spk_2:** [25:50.44 - 26:05.66] right?And the word they take out is God because somehow or other they're worried about the separation of church and state in a story about Jewish life in a small rural town over 100 years ago in Central Europe.I mean that's absurd.

**spk_0:** [26:05.85 - 26:09.69] Well,it does show to what lengths they will go.Let's,let's try another call.

**spk_1:** [26:09.76 - 26:14.87] All right,let's pick up on Connie in Peoria,Illinois over WPEO.

**spk_0:** [26:15.13 - 26:17.39] Hello,Connie,what is your question or comment?

**spk_4:** [26:17.68 - 26:57.72] OK,um,I'm a young mother.I've got two children.One's in 4th grade and one is in,um,1st grade,and this really upsets me when I hear things like that.My children do go to a public school.And um what I'd like to ask the gentleman is what do we do as parents for our children?Do we write to the book companies?Um,you know,as a Christian parent,I'm going to let my children know what the real story of Thanksgiving is.But on the other hand,you know,you have children in the public school that's hearing all this and it's not right.

**spk_0:** [26:58.04 - 27:00.79] Well,let's ask Doctor Vitz how he would respond to that.

**spk_2:** [27:01.40 - 27:30.64] Well,your question is a very good one,and it's a difficult one,however,to answer.Um,there are lots of ways I could suggest you go about it.Um,I guess the main thing is to find out what are the books that are being used in your children's,ah,school and to look and to look at them.And then see if you can speak to the A teacher or to the principal and say,look,I think there must be better books than these books that don't leave this out.

**spk_0:** [27:31.04 - 27:52.34] Another way,Doctor Vitz,don't you think,is to tell a mother to go to the library and find school,uh,find books for the grade level of her child,uh,that were published more than 25 years ago.That's one thing some mothers have been doing,and they're finding some very lovely stories that are available if you look for the publication date.

**spk_2:** [27:52.78 - 28:37.81] Yes,that will help too,and that's stories that sometimes not only your children will be able to read,but that the teacher might be quite willing,particularly if they're in the public library or in the school library,ah,to put back into the classroom as some sort of supplementary reading.So those are ways in a practical sense that you can try to improve things,but otherwise you have to recognize this,that the public school establishment.Has a philosophy of education that's been created in the last 50 years by the schools of education around the country,and that philosophy of education is like the schools of education around the country,secular and relatively liberal,and they're not really interested in being fair about these things.

**spk_1:** [30:07.72 - 30:26.76] On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live and an interesting conversation about a man's landmark study of how religion and traditional values are portrayed in our nation's textbooks.Keep those calls coming,folks.1-800-736-3202.Before we

**spk_0:** [30:26.76 - 30:50.81] go back to our calls,uh,Doctor Vitz,I wanna ask you about traditional values,a marriage and family and how they are treated in.These social studies books,uh,do they say that marriage and family,uh,can be viewed in the traditional light,or do they give you a lot of pro-feminist propaganda about how women should be coal miners and men should be washing the dishes?Well,

**spk_2:** [30:50.88 - 31:00.19] it was much closer to that second alternative.Uh,one of the things that was interesting to me is they never mentioned marriage or weddings in these textbooks at all.

**spk_0:** [31:00.31 - 31:03.63] You just live together without any mention of marriage,I guess so.

**spk_2:** [31:03.74 - 31:27.87] You know,the public schools.Um,you know,wring their hands about,ah,illegitimacy and,you know,ah,unwanted teenage pregnancy and so on,but they do absolutely nothing to,ah,head the problem off by being reasonable about traditional understandings of marriage in their own textbooks.Um,for example,they don't even mention the word husband or the word wife.

**spk_0:** [31:28.04 - 31:32.13] Oh,those are sexist words.Don't you realize that in the new feminist dictionary?

**spk_2:** [31:32.67 - 31:38.06] Well,I thought at least they were sort of equivalent,you know,husband and wife just refer to a,you know,

**spk_0:** [31:38.43 - 31:46.34] oh,for the,for the people who are promoting a gender neutral society.Those are sexist words and you should just talk about relationships

**spk_2:** [31:46.34 - 31:49.30] between people where they're not married and therefore there's no husband or wife.

**spk_0:** [31:49.66 - 31:57.29] Well,regardless of your viewpoint,wouldn't you say that this is censorship of,of the way our society really is?

**spk_2:** [31:57.42 - 32:24.00] Absolutely.I mean,these textbooks are censorship right down the line,and these are the people who are always complaining when conservatives complain and calling the conservatives the censors.But the only way they can get away with that,the only reason they can get away with that,is all the censoring they've done has been done quietly and in advance.And so nobody seems to notice it,and their major way of censoring is to take things out.

**spk_0:** [32:24.36 - 32:30.11] Well,we thank you for noticing it.Let's go to a caller and see what our listeners have to ask you.

**spk_1:** [32:30.28 - 32:35.04] Inez,Florence,South Carolina,W O L S B Phyllis-Schlafly.

**spk_0:** [32:35.15 - 32:37.37] Hello,Inez.What is your question or comment?

**spk_5:** [32:38.12 - 33:32.66] Yes,I have one comment on something I heard on today's program,and then if I may,on a program you had a week or so ago.Uh My,uh,grandson,uh,this is in relation to the caller about the Bible's not being allowed in the,uh,black school for the blind.My grandson who goes to school in Lake Worth,Florida and is a senior there.The particular school that he goes to,uh,he told me that,you know,his Christian viewpoints,he was given a lot of static on it.And then he started taking his Bible to school,and that seemed to take the to take them off guard.And he wasn't given near as much static,and so far as I know,no,nothing has been said about him taking his Bible to school.Which I think is good news.

**spk_0:** [33:33.20 - 33:57.19] Well,I,I think that's fine,and I can't see that the school should object if he simply carries his Bible to school.We are not urging that the teacher teach out of the Bible.We know that that can't be done today,but we do point out the censorship.Of the facts of our religious heritage.Right.Well,thank you,thank you very much,Dr.Vitz.Do you have any comment on that?

**spk_2:** [33:58.35 - 34:35.65] One thing that this woman's comment makes clear is that America is a big country and there are lots of differences as you move from town to town and from region to region and from school to school.And every now and then we do hear examples like that which she mentioned,which means that there's still some of the good old American common sense and fair play.Allowed and usually that's at the local level,the place where the American fair play is sort of neglected and excluded and the place where the bias really comes in is at the higher levels where the policies and the bureaucracies and the government get involved

**spk_0:** [34:35.65 - 34:38.81] and where they write and select the textbooks.Very good.

**spk_1:** [34:39.79 - 34:56.64] And oh before we.Hiz.Want to tell her she can call our number during the week and we can field her question about a previous week's show.And that goes for anyone out there who does have a question on a past Philly Schlafly Live show.We move on to Trenton,New Jersey.Here's Don over at WCHR.

**spk_0:** [34:56.89 - 34:59.14] Hello,Don.What is your question or comment?

**spk_6:** [34:59.77 - 35:42.84] Well,hi,I happen to have a sister that's an elementary school teacher and I happen to work as a police officer at a northeastern college.And I've noticed that,ah,friends' religious beliefs are certainly being challenged and dismantled,ah,by some of the college staff or some of the other people that they go to school with.And as a police officer and now a Christian cop,I've seen and heard and been in situations where I can see where Christian principles are lacking and would have certainly helped a little or a lot,and I feel it's because of the,ah,I or me generation philosophy and also the censorship of Christian values at schools and certainly in homes.

**spk_0:** [35:43.68 - 35:47.65] Uh,well,I will ask,Doctor Vitz if he has a comment on that.Well,

**spk_2:** [35:47.85 - 36:36.68] first of all,what he's observed is very perceptive.He's noticed things going on around him,and that's very important.And it's one of the things he's brought up is that a lot of this is going on in our colleges,at,you know,not just the Ivy League colleges by any means.It's going on in our state universities and Ah,our junior colleges,it's going on at almost all levels,and that's one of the places where all of this began.And as Christians become aware of this and alert to it,there is one positive thing we become aware of the fact that we're going to have to stand up for our faith,that we're going to have to pay a price,and that it's no longer,ah,something that is just somehow or other going along with the culture.If you're a serious Christian today,you're in a countercultural position,

**spk_0:** [36:37.08 - 36:42.96] and all we want is fair treatment for the Christians.They should have just as many rights as the atheists in the public schools.

**spk_1:** [36:43.09 - 36:55.10] 1-800-736-3202.That's 1-800-736-3202.Hope to hear from you.Here's Mike in Houston,Texas over KTEK.

**spk_0:** [36:55.32 - 36:57.68] Hello,Mike.What is your question or comment?Yes,

**spk_2:** [36:58.04 - 37:03.71] for Professor Witz,um,I was just wondering,there's,I would,I would guess there's,uh,

**spk_0:** [37:04.28 - 37:06.15] talk a little louder,Mike.I would

**spk_2:** [37:06.15 - 38:07.74] guess there's basically two views,um,of,uh,academic Christians today concerning Christians and American history,and I think one of them would maybe epitomized by,um,Peter Marshall,David Manuel's view.And then,uh,I hope Professor Vitz can follow me on this.I'm sure he's up on this,and I think another view might be espoused by,um,some Christian historians in the Middle West at Notre Dame,Wheaton College,uh,George Marsden,um,Nathan Hatch.Um,I was just wondering,uh,if,uh,Professor Vitz could help me with this,um.Why do these people come down on different sides,and for a young Christian who's,uh,dealing with some,uh,important important questions concerning our country's religious heritage,um,what should this individual look at to determine,uh,which is the best for you?

**spk_0:** [38:08.26 - 38:29.95] Well,let's ask Dr.Vitz what he thinks,but I,uh,interpreted his study as basically,um,a,a,um,an,an explanation of factual historical inaccuracy,uh,rather than,uh,that it was presenting one view of society.Now you'd like to comment on that,Doctor Bit?Well,uh,

**spk_2:** [38:30.58 - 39:31.60] you're right,Phyllis.That's what my study was about.But the young man's question was about the fact that the Christian community,serious and committed Christians,don't always by any means agree exactly on what the role of Christianity has been in American history.And here I would just suggest that he,ah,I mean,I don't,don't want to get into the business of being a historian of American,ah,I mean in the detailed professional sense,a historian of America with respect to,ah,Christian influences and Christian character.And so I would suggest that he just call or write,Professor Marsden or others on that side and as well as the names that he mentioned on the other and read and reflect on their positions as best as he can and come to a decision on his own,because I,I can't wear the hat of being a good historian with respect to the Disagreements about the emphasis or the way in which Christianity influenced our country.

**spk_0:** [39:31.90 - 39:48.05] And at the university level,many of these things can be discussed and handed handled in a debatable way,but at the elementary and secondary level,it seems to me that they ought to stick to what is true and accurate and pretty well accepted.

**spk_2:** [39:48.39 - 40:01.93] Agreed,yes.And I just would like to encourage him to,if he's really serious about this issue in question,to contact the people involved.I expect if he's read some of their works to begin with,that they'll be happy to speak with him on the phone or.

**spk_1:** [40:02.22 - 40:11.59] And that's Professor Paul Vitz.Hang on there just a second.We'll pick up,uh,Doctor Vitz and on the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_7:** [40:15.15 - 41:14.20] Eagle-Forum has been leading the pro-family movement to victory since 1972.Eagle-Forum has achieved an unmatched record of success,stopping the anti-family Equal Rights Amendment,preserving women's exemption from the military draft in combat duty,working for federal and state legislation to eliminate child pornography.That's proof that citizen volunteers can determine government policies in Congress and in state legislatures,but the fight continues.Eagle-Forum is now working for a tax credit for every child,for parents and pupils' rights and education,for economic growth through lower taxes,for a strong national defense.And for private enterprise,join us,the men and women of Eagle-Forum who share conservative pro-family values with a faith in God,in America,and with hope for the future based on freedom and opportunity for all.Wright Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_8:** [41:15.66 - 42:14.73] Too many children have been cheated out of the education they deserve.Did you know that nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science?That's a problem we can no longer afford to ignore.Educational excellence in the public school starts with respect for the rights of students,parents,and taxpayers.But what are they?Every student has the right to be taught to read the English language in the first grade.Every student has the right to family privacy,the right to his religious faith and beliefs,the right to share information with his parents.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy from Eagle-Forum.Learn more about the rights you and your children should expect.The Student's Bill of Rights.Get your copy by writing Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.

**spk_1:** [42:16.56 - 42:31.60] On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and what do you say we jump right back into telephone calls because a lot of them are lined up here,Phyllis.Let's visit in Wisconsin,in Brookfield specifically.Here's Carol over at WKSH.

**spk_0:** [42:31.98 - 42:34.21] Hello,Carol,what is your question or comment?

**spk_9:** [42:34.53 - 44:12.41] Well,I,I had a comment.My son has the McMillan,uh,textbook series,and there's something that is very disturbing to me.And that is,ah,in the studies of North and South America.Ah,they have been mentioning missionaries,ah,but predominantly in a negative light,as in,ah,bringing in,ah,Foreigners to subjugate the people.Uh,when it talks about.The,um,Spanish,it says Aztecs fled in terror as Spanish guns destroyed the city.Buildings fell in ruins.That's a quote.Then when it talks about the Aztecs,uh,and the way they,uh,Subjugated their own people.It says if people rebelled against,um,excuse me,this particular one's Inca,against Inca rule,the army moved them to an area near the capital city where it was nearly impossible to continue the rebellion.It also talks about,uh,the rulers owned the property.The people own nothing.It was everyone's duty to serve the state.The emperor in return ensured that all the people had food,clothes,shelter,and protection.The only place where it says anything good about or almost the only place where it says anything good about preachers is when they're talking about,uh,preachers who helped them throw uh uh fathers,who helped them throw off the rule of the Spanish,and I,I find that this is setting them up for the whole,uh,idea of liberation.

**spk_0:** [44:13.18 - 44:20.24] Well,let's get Doctor Vitz's views on,uh,when they do talk about religion,uh,they're presenting it in a negative light.

**spk_2:** [44:20.98 - 44:58.47] Well,that's true.I mostly found that they didn't talk about it,but when you,when they did talk about it and what,what this,uh,woman from Wisconsin has found,I came across every now and then.Ah,I didn't make a point of it in my study because other things seemed to me to be more important,but I agree with you.I came across textbooks like that.They are grossly unfair.They say nothing about the Aztec,ah,repression of people.They say nothing about the,ah,human sacrifice by the thousands that characterized Aztec,ah,political and religious life.Uh,

**spk_0:** [44:59.70 - 45:11.14] what about the Christian missionaries?I,I live on the Mississippi River where Father Marquette came down as a missionary,and,and they played such a great role in development of our nation.Do they appear in the social studies books?

**spk_2:** [45:11.70 - 45:34.69] Never in the social studies books that I came across.They did sometimes occur briefly in the history books,American history books,but even then they,I mean,nobody ever once said,what does the name San Francisco,St.Louis.Um,the Los Angeles.Uh,where do these names come from?You know,no one ever explained.

**spk_0:** [45:35.37 - 45:36.89] They're not in the questions for discussion.

**spk_1:** [45:37.21 - 45:42.89] 1-800-736-3202.Leslie in St.Louis over KSIV.

**spk_0:** [45:43.13 - 45:45.93] Hello,Leslie,what is your question or comment?Yes,well,I have

**spk_4:** [45:45.93 - 48:12.86] a comment.I have a book here.It's called If You Lived in Colonial Times.I have a copy in front of me.I threw away all the other copies.I was going to give them to the children.I am a school teacher.And,uh,this is put out by Scholastic Incorporated,and they make quite a few little booklets for the children in the schools,and this is written for the 3rd grade level and this book on if you lived in colonial times talks about,uh,like what the kind of clothes the children would wear about the school system and what would happen if you didn't behave,and he was just talking about,uh,About how sometimes things will be presented about God or religion,but it's in a negative way and that the lady that was just before me was discussing this and that's what I was talking about.It talks about what did the people do on Sunday in the colonial days.And it says everyone has to go to church,and it's real negative.All the things they had about the church and the and the pictures that the artist drew here are very,very awful.I mean,the,the pictures show faces that are stern and unhappy and,um,that explains that if children,it says here children tried not to wiggle around.They tried not to fall asleep during the long prayers,the Bible reading the hymns and the sermons,it says what happens if you did fall asleep.And it said if a baby fell asleep no one cared,but it said if you fell asleep and speaking to the children,you would get a rap on the head from the church watchman.And all through here it's just,it's bad.It has a picture of the minister and he's yelling and he's got his arm up in the air and he's got a real hateful expression on his face.It says if anyone smiled or whispered in the meeting house and it talks about how this one man would write down the person's name and the man who smiles or whispers had to pay a fine if they did this during the church service and it said you couldn't laugh or smile or anything.And also said it was against the law to kiss your mother or father on Sunday,gives some special Sunday laws,and I,one other thing is that later on it talks about the ducking stool where they,they punish people.It says if a if a woman,um,talked back to her husband,she had to take the ducking stool for punishment,but there's so many negative things in this that a child reading this book would end up hating Christianity and hating the,the whole,uh,colonial period.I mean there's a few good things in this book,but it's so bad I wouldn't even give it out to the children,and they do have a series that also has other books which I have not seen,but says more books in this unique series from Scholastic.If you Sailed on the Mayflower.If you lived with the Sioux Indians,if you grew up with Abraham Lincoln,if you grew up with George Washington,so I haven't seen the others in the series,but if this is part of it,I don't want to be part of it.

**spk_0:** [48:13.22 - 48:22.64] Well,uh,thank you for telling us,and I know Doctor Vitz will be happy to know that our listeners are people who read their children's textbooks.Let's see if we can squeeze one more call in.

**spk_4:** [49:17.37 - 49:29.71] this is what I want to say that there's not one word that has to do.With God,uh,let's see,I have my list here.
