**spk_0:** [00:01.47 - 00:10.97] This is the Phyllis-Schlafly Live program for September 23rd,and it starts in 5432,

**spk_1:** [00:11.21 - 00:22.95] 1.Unknown to most Americans,the United States government has agreed to let the Soviet Union work with us in the development of teaching materials for public school children.

**spk_0:** [00:25.29 - 00:56.16] Welcome to Phyllis-Schlafly Live.I'm Bruce Hayes,and today a program about some strange influences on curriculum in the public schools.Do you think our schools should be cooperating with the Russians to develop teaching materials,videos,computer software,and textbooks for use in American schools?Now we won't be taking your Calls today because we've prerecorded a program with some special guests who have made a study of this issue.Stay tuned.I think you'll be surprised at the information we have to give you today.Philip.

**spk_1:** [00:56.23 - 01:08.83] Our first guest today probably knows more about this issue than anyone else in the country.Mrs.Charlotte Iserbeed is a former official of the US Department of Education.And now is a writer and consultant living in Maine,

**spk_0:** [01:08.93 - 01:12.09] and she's on the line with us from Camden,Maine,as a matter of fact.

**spk_1:** [01:12.43 - 01:27.79] Good morning,Charlotte.Are you there?Yes,good morning,Phyllis.Thank you for joining us.Thank you for asking me on.We want to talk about this US-Soviet agreement about education.I think most people don't know about it at all.How did you first learn about it?Well,

**spk_2:** [01:28.11 - 02:07.06] I have to give credit to a friend of mine in Washington who was a very alert newspaper reader who clipped.An article that was in the,I believe in the Washington Post,ah,where they pretty much gave the text they did,they gave the text of the agreement,and,ah,then,ah,without her,ah,none of us would have known about it because there was very little press afterward and,ah,that particular article in The Washington Post said that,uh,Let's see now.That was to promote cooperation in the development of educational exchanges and software related instruction for elementary and secondary school students.Well,

**spk_1:** [02:07.14 - 02:09.19] were you shocked when you read that in the paper?

**spk_2:** [02:09.28 - 02:17.82] Oh,I was absolutely appalled because,well,first of all,government,our US Department of Education isn't even meant to develop curriculum.

**spk_1:** [02:18.02 - 02:22.94] I thought there was a law against the federal government getting into the curriculum of public schools.

**spk_2:** [02:23.03 - 02:40.07] Well,there is.There's the General Education Provisions Act,and of course they ignore that.The US Department ignores that pretty much.But,but I never dreamt that we would have a United States.Educators sitting down with Soviet educators.In fact,they're sitting right now,or they've left,they left Leningrad a couple of weeks ago.But well,

**spk_1:** [02:40.15 - 02:42.98] when did they first sit down and get together on this agreement?

**spk_2:** [02:43.05 - 03:14.57] They sat down in 19,I would say in 1986.Well,they had been sitting down for quite a while,so these agreements were the original agreements were signed in 1958.Nobody really knew much about them because they were not as extensive as they are now.They have had a,a textbook agreement for quite a long time.They've been working on that.Soviet and Eastern European scholars have been going back and forth across the,uh,the ocean for ever since 1958.There has been a lot of tax money.

**spk_1:** [03:14.75 - 03:22.59] Well,now that project,Charlotte was a project to survey the way that each country sees the other in its textbooks.Is that

**spk_2:** [03:22.59 - 04:04.08] correct?Well,yes,in the textbooks and in other areas as well.When I'm talking about them going back and forth across the ocean,the International Research Exchange Board and the American Council of Learned Societies,they have had extensive funding by the American taxpayers over the years for studying in various areas,not just textbooks.However,this latest agreement was Quite a shocker because it actually called for development of curriculum.The other studies call for perhaps,you know,trying to make the textbooks a little bit less biased or one thing or the other.I don't think they're biased at all.I don't think you can be very biased and you're talking about the Soviet Union and its atrocities.But anyway,well,

**spk_1:** [04:04.12 - 04:08.58] the real fault in American textbooks is that they don't tell it as bad as it really is.

**spk_2:** [04:08.88 - 04:09.14] Exactly.

**spk_1:** [04:09.68 - 04:16.39] Well,now the real agreement that we're discussing today.is the one that was signed in November 1985,isn't it,in Geneva.

**spk_2:** [04:16.79 - 05:05.17] And the text of that agreement,I'll,I'll just read a little bit of it.It says the parties will encourage the conclusion when it is considered mutually beneficial of agreements on cooperation in the field of science and technology,that's computers and all,and also additional agreements in other specific fields,including,and this is what bothers us the most,the humanities and social.Sciences.Then it goes on and it commits the United States and the Soviet Union to the facilitation of the exchange by appropriate organizations of educational and teaching materials,including textbooks,syllabi,and curricula,materials on methodology.That's very important.That's how you teach and surely the Soviets,we do not want to use their system.Samples of teaching instruments and audio visual aids.Well,

**spk_1:** [05:05.28 - 05:32.25] well,that particular section that you just read,I think is the crux of what we're disturbed about with this agreement because it talks about developing the educational materials including textbooks,syllabi,curricula,teaching methods,and all those elements that go into what,what and how we are actually taught in the American public schools and the whole idea of having an agreement with the Soviet Union,blows the mind,doesn't it?

**spk_2:** [05:32.94 - 06:30.07] Well,it certainly does,and Phyllis,especially since I have a very,very important,uh,paper here in front of me dated August 19986.It's Comparative Education Review.It's one of those education journals that only leading educators get in this country.And,uh,there's an article in there by Beatrice Beachezekele,and it's called The New Soviet Educational Reform.And it's very interesting because Gorbachev evidently has been quite deeply involved in education prior to his taking his present position.But in 1986,this study says that the reform movement in the Soviet Union,they're going to revise the academic school curriculum,enhance the position of teachers,and this is the most important thing for people to listen to when they're thinking about art cooperating with the Soviet Union.It says,and to intensify ideological education.

**spk_1:** [06:33.06 - 07:26.00] Well,the idea that we should be cooperating with the Russians on this is just very shocking to all of us.Going back to this agreement in 1985,it was signed,I believe,by our Secretary of State George Shultz and the Russian Shevardnadze.And it also applied to educational films,to documentary films,and really to everything that goes into the school materials.Now,Charlotte,I was in Geneva at that time while trying to monitor Ronald Reagan and his meetings with Gorbachev and to prevent them from doing any.Out on SDI,the Strategic Defense Initiative,we heard nothing about this education agreement at all.It was all very quiet.It must have gone on behind closed doors while everybody was talking about what was going to be signed or not signed about SDI.

**spk_2:** [07:26.35 - 09:45.88] Well,I believe that they had,they had been working on this for over a year,and I had an interview with someone who was deeply involved in it in the beginning.In fact,Gregory Gurro,who's the head of the exchanges.Uh,office now at the USIA and I had a long,about a half an hour interview with him,uh,right after they were signed,and,uh,he admitted that these,these,these agreements had been worked on for a year prior to Reagan signing the,uh,the Geneva agreement,and we,of course,uh,I think Phy aside from.The outrageous aspects of the formal US-Soviet education agreements.I believe that the Carnegie Corporation agreement,which really goes parallels,and they're both connected,is,uh,well,perhaps not more dangerous,but certainly as dangerous because why,well,it,it calls for,it's unbelievable.It says here they had these meetings prior to the signing of the official US-Soviet agreement in Geneva.The New York Times reports that a meeting of American and Soviet educational computer experts has produced an agreement to exchange specialists involved in the improvement of elementary and secondary education.Now,the initial American-Soviet exchange is extended,intended as a first step toward cooperation among education reformers from a number.Countries including Britain and Japan.But then it goes on,it says the discussions were held October 24,29 in Moscow prior to the Geneva,were carried out under the auspices of Carnegie and the Soviet Academy of Sciences.They The preparatory talks between Hamburg,David Hamburg of the Foundation and Velikov.You hear a lot about him.He's very close to Gorbachev,our vice president of the Soviet Academy.Uh,it says the negotiations,and they,they,they tell us that they did not give us approval.George Shultz's State Department said they did not give approval,but interestingly enough,uh,the fellow Hechinger,who wrote this article,who's on the board of Carnegie and writes for The New York Times,said,quote,The negotiations had the prior approval of the State Department and National Security Advisors.

**spk_1:** [09:46.04 - 10:07.60] Well,that's very strange.I thought it was supposed to be illegal for private citizens and private institutions in our country to make deals with foreign governments.And of course we all know when you talk about the Soviet Academy,it's not a private organization as the Carnegie is in this country.Soviet Academy has got the direct approval of the Kremlin bosses.Well,

**spk_2:** [10:07.64 - 10:22.09] it's very hard to see.This is what We have,we haven't been able to get any answer on this.We also have a big problem with New York State's Education Department signing an agreement with,because that's the state of New York signing an agreement with the Soviet Union.

**spk_1:** [10:22.21 - 10:30.29] I thought that sort of thing was illegal.I did,I didn't think individual states in this country could sign their own agreements with foreign governments.Well,that's true.

**spk_2:** [10:30.37 - 11:17.03] The Constitution,I think it's,and,you know the Constitution better than I do,but it says right there that states are not allowed to sign agreements with foreign governments.And so we,we're being ignored on this.I have asked Senator Cohen.It's been 6 months now since he told me he was going to get an opinion from the State Department legal counsel about the New York State agreement,and that agreement,by the way,sets up an arrangement for cooperation between the Soviet Union and American schools,not just New York State.For our children to have the Soviets coming into the classroom on video,it's just like having,you know how it is,Phyllis.If we can't make a speech somewhere in the United States,we send the video.It's cheaper.It's just as effective,

**spk_1:** [11:17.31 - 11:20.62] and we're going to cooperate with the Soviets in making these videos,

**spk_2:** [11:20.67 - 11:31.03] in making them,and also in,in they're sending us their videos for our children to be exposed to.It's like they're coming right into our classroom,but

**spk_1:** [11:31.47 - 11:47.57] now tell me,Charlotte,the agreement,the principal agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union on this issue was signed in Geneva in November of 1985.Now how do you see the effects of this agreement?Is anything really happening in American schools?

**spk_2:** [11:47.74 - 12:10.57] This is what is so aggravating,Phyllis,that we've been told.You know,nothing's going to really come of it.And first of all,a conference took place between July 20th and August 12th in Leningrad,and it was,it was teaching for critical thinking.And what happened there was that the,is that

**spk_1:** [12:10.57 - 12:11.04] this year,

**spk_2:** [12:11.18 - 14:11.03] that was this year,and it was the second institute.The first one was held in in Massachusetts or New Hampshire last year,but this was the second one,and it says.That Soviet in 2020 Soviet and 20 American educators will meet in Leningrad.They've already done it,to examine classroom theory and practice in critical thinking about social and political issues.Now,the result of will be used,it says for use by teachers and students in both countries.Now,when you talk about critical thinking,Phyllis,I've done a lot of research here.I have a book that came out of the University of Pittsburgh library by a fellow called Landa on Lenin,and Lenin coined most of the words about thinking.He was great for this.What we are looking at in the way of critical thinking is nothing more than dialectical materialism.He and,uh,so this critical thinking that's going on across the United States,the purpose of it is simply to change children's attitudes and values and get them to question and critique everything that their families believe in,that the country believes in anything.But it's,it's bad enough when we have this happening in the American public schools every day with our children under the guise of,of.Thinking straight,huh?Uh,bad enough to have it with American educators,but when we have our educators over there sitting with their educators and they're,they're discussing critical thinking about peace and about social and political issues now,and this is coming back into the classroom,OK,that's number 1 thing that's going on now.Number 2,I told you about the New York State Agreement.That's the joint venture of the New York-based Copen Foundation in New York State Department of Ed.Uh,that 3 year program will bring together a dozen American schools with counterparts in the USSR,and it says Soviet officials are especially interested in studying the effect of telecommunications on intercultural understanding,teaching methods,and learning outcomes.

**spk_1:** [14:11.37 - 14:14.55] And that involves the student and teacher exchanges,correct?

**spk_2:** [14:15.08 - 14:15.09] Absolutely.

**spk_1:** [14:16.33 - 14:36.41] We're running out of time.We need to take a break,Charlotte.I hope you'll stand by for after the break.We want to hear more about the student exchanges because we're starting to read about those in our local papers,and I assume you would think that that was the outcome of that agreement that was signed with the Russians in 1985.Definitely.All right,we'll be back in a couple of minutes.

**spk_0:** [14:36.57 - 15:19.12] Phyllis finding out some startling information today on some influences on curriculum in our public schools,and we'll continue to talk about this.Just a quick note that in order for this program to stay on the air in your city,We'll need to hear from you just at least a word of encouragement and certainly if you can,a gift would help us out.Here's our address and be sure to include your hometown station's call letters.It's Eagle-Forum Education,Alton,Illinois 62002.Again,Eagle-Forum Education,Alton,Illinois,62002.From the USA Radio Network.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_4:** [16:29.48 - 16:32.00] From the To the west we're standing

**spk_5:** [16:50.47 - 17:09.42] Constant.high above

**spk_0:** [17:30.92 - 17:34.49] On the USA Radio Network,this is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_1:** [17:34.85 - 18:18.16] Well,welcome back.We're talking about the agreement made between the United States and the Soviet Union in Geneva in 1985 that pertains to the development of curricula for public schools.This is so outrageous that it's very.Hard to understand that it really has taken place.Most people don't know that it happened.I will tell you that if you write in for our $10 kit on US-Soviet agreements,we will include the 41 page agreement that was signed by our Secretary of State Schultz in 1985.And now we're going to go to another guest who's made a study of this subject,Anne Frazier of Roanoke Rapids,North Carolina.Anne,are you on the line?Yes,

**spk_6:** [18:18.28 - 18:20.66] good morning.Thank you for covering this subject.

**spk_1:** [18:20.76 - 18:24.38] And how did you find out about this subject,which most people don't know about?

**spk_6:** [18:24.88 - 18:30.33] I read the article in The New York Times in November of.1985

**spk_1:** [18:30.66 - 18:46.44] that was the that was the famous Fred Hechinger report and of course we knew that he had to be an authority on this subject since I believe he's both a trustee of Carnegie as well as was present when they signed their agreement.

**spk_6:** [18:46.70 - 18:49.20] Yes,that's what we had learned through our research.

**spk_1:** [18:50.15 - 18:51.29] So what did you find?

**spk_6:** [18:52.11 - 19:12.89] Well,basically we got a copy of the agreement from the State Department also,and then we began to learn of the connection with Carnegie and uh for many,many months,Carnegie was mute.They did not want to tell us anything and indeed they still don't want to tell us very much about their role.

**spk_1:** [19:14.07 - 19:21.63] Well,Carnegie is the foundation that is always issuing orders about how they could improve American education,aren't they?

**spk_6:** [19:21.71 - 19:32.29] And they've been up to their scheme since the 1930s,and they've been promoting world interdependence or collectivism.For 50 years now

**spk_1:** [19:32.35 - 19:35.15] and also disarmament and world government absolutely

**spk_6:** [19:35.15 - 20:08.22] and they've also expanded now into the states and North Carolina has had a group to form called the Public Forum,which is a child of the Carnegie Foundation.And is headed in North Carolina.It was begun and,and they're working with our former governor Jim Hunt,and he's playing a key role now in this national certification of teachers board.He's appearing before Congress asking for $50 million to set up his certification board for teachers.

**spk_1:** [20:09.06 - 20:16.06] Anne,would you say that the Carnegie.Foundation is a principal promoter of the idea of national certification for teachers.

**spk_6:** [20:16.17 - 20:17.16] Oh,absolutely.

**spk_1:** [20:17.40 - 20:18.88] And why do you think that's bad?

**spk_6:** [20:19.54 - 21:05.90] Well,I just think when you've got a tax-free organization like this or foundation with a history that they have and the public,they do not run for office.They are not elected.The public has.Absolutely no control over them.We cannot uh control their budget we cannot control their policies we cannot control what they're doing.We can't they have admitted to us in our state,look,we organized to circumvent the state department of public instruction and also the state board of education.Now these people are hired and.Uh,put in office by the governor himself,the state board of education,and of course we elect the governor and he's one of our friends,and they,well,well,

**spk_1:** [21:06.00 - 21:14.80] would you say,Anne,that the Carnegie Foundation was a real direct assault on the whole idea of local control of education?Yes,it is.

**spk_6:** [21:14.86 - 21:22.28] And when they expanded into the states like this with other groups,you know,they're controlling education and the public has no control over them.

**spk_1:** [21:22.44 - 21:35.29] Well,now the reason Carnegie is.Important in the context of the US-Soviet agreements is that they worked up the first agreement and probably were the driving force behind the one that was signed in Geneva in 1985.Yes,

**spk_6:** [21:35.42 - 21:38.86] working through the Academy of Sciences and the,

**spk_1:** [21:39.14 - 21:51.34] well,the Soviet Academy of Sciences is just like a Politburo agency.Oh,intelligence,yes.Well,what evidence do you see of this Soviet agreement in in North Carolina schools?

**spk_6:** [21:51.77 - 21:59.38] Well,we are seeing that we do have exchanges at Wake Forest University.Just recently,the Soviets were there and we,

**spk_1:** [21:59.53 - 22:00.84] we,you mean real Russians

**spk_6:** [22:00.84 - 22:01.83] in Chapel Hill.

**spk_1:** [22:02.07 - 22:07.84] You mean real Russians came over?Oh absolutely,students or teachers?Were they students or teachers?

**spk_6:** [22:08.18 - 23:02.75] These were students and they are exchanged also in Chapel Hill schools.They are pushing,pushing the.Uh,you know,curriculum already calling it the conflict resolution and the peace curriculum in the Chapel Hill area and we're also seeing the exchanges not just in education but in other aspects of life through agriculture and the economy,the business and corporations,they're visiting each other.We have a sister city at Black Mountain.Where they exchanging during the year they have a calendar already with uh all the the celebrations from both countries listed and you're just supposed to celebrate all of the uh holidays and everything from both countries.We have several sister cities in fact Durham and and some of the others in North Carolina are thinking about organizing now to have sister cities in the Soviet Union.

**spk_1:** [23:02.88 - 23:09.20] Uh,Anne,didn't you have something to do with the resolution that was passed by the Southern Baptist was

**spk_6:** [23:09.20 - 23:12.70] interesting that you did.Charles Stanley was just speaking on your program there.

**spk_1:** [23:14.06 - 23:16.98] I did.That's Dr.Charles Stanley of Atlanta,Georgia.

**spk_6:** [23:17.12 - 23:57.19] Yes,and he's former president of the Southern Baptist Convention,and he was in San Antonio the year that I introduced,this was the year before last.I introduced a resolution.To expose this whole agreement to the Southern Baptists,and there were about 20,000 people there at the time we introduced the resolution.And then afterwards we mailed it to over 60,000 churches and pastors so that we could get the information to our 14 million Southern Baptists,and we asked them to be alert to this,to watch out for it,and also to approach their congressman and ask for a full investigation and explanation of this whole process

**spk_1:** [23:57.55 - 24:08.66] since there has been almost nothing in the press.On this subject,what kind of reaction do your people get when they write to their congressman?I'll bet a lot of congressmen say I never heard of it.

**spk_6:** [24:09.14 - 24:31.83] They haven't,and many of them are in shock,and many of them feel that their hands are tied when they then approach the State Department in Washington or Carnegie themselves,and they,they get the run around just like the public is.I think we just need to keep after them and say,look,we elected you to office to do something for us and we are not going to give up.

**spk_1:** [24:32.44 - 25:06.02] Uh,thank you,Anne.Uh,stand by and let's go back to Charlotte Izerbeed in Maine.And Charlotte,I noticed that Anne was talking about some of the student and teacher exchanges.A lot of people would say,Well,what's the matter with having some Russians come over and look at our schools?Maybe they might learn something.They might get some ideas for freedom.They might defect.They might contribute to the upheaval that's going on behind the Iron Curtain.What's the matter of our people going over and observing what's really going on in the Soviet Union?

**spk_2:** [25:06.74 - 25:06.94] Well,

**spk_1:** [25:07.02 - 25:08.95] are you there?Yes,I'm here.Yeah,well,

**spk_2:** [25:09.06 - 27:09.29] I think that,you know,Secretary Bennett spoke before the Kansas City Chamber of Commerce in 1986,and he said in regard to this,quote,American students know very little about their own history and heritage,and quote,We have forgotten that intellectual innocence is easily seduced,and the price we pay is that some of our children can only nod their heads in agreement when confronted with standard Soviet propaganda.They lack the knowledge to recognize it as propaganda,much less to refute it.That's,that's American students going over,over there.Now,you know,before they go,Phyllis,I have a somewhere around here,a very interesting Bangor Daily News article.Before the students left for the Soviet Union.And they were all saying that they would be so it's going to be so helpful to them to be able to really see the Soviet Union because all they've heard is biased stereotypes and everything in the United States and,and that it's not fair for them to only have one side,and this is pathetic.So when they go over first of all with that attitude,you can imagine what they come back with.And now on the other hand,the students coming over here,we've had a lot of this in Maine.I'm immersed with it.Every time I turn around,I see we've got Russians invading our,our schools,invading our churches.We had some in church last week.Now I found that very interesting.It's a marvelous Episcopal church and a very traditional one,and they were singing.Well,they couldn't sing because they're from the opera,from the Soviet opera,I believe,but they were sitting in our choir.And there was a woman behind me.You know how Americans are so generous,and she,she just couldn't wait to throw $100 in the plate to pay for their expenses.Well,now I may be wrong,Phyllis,but would you,maybe you can help me out.Are Russians allowed to leave the Soviet Union without Permission from the state.Well,

**spk_1:** [27:09.37 - 27:52.98] of course,they have to get their visa and it has to be approved.And you know that the Soviet Union only allows those people to leave on whom they have a hold,so they're sure they get them back.Of course,every now and then they slip up and somebody defects,but they also pick people who are very trained.I read about a confrontation between Russian and American high school students in Virginia.And it was very clear that the Russian students had been clearly trained in how to debate the Americans and the Americans were just like your average teenager,didn't know a whole lot about history,didn't know really anything about the truth on the Soviet Union,and they were babes in the woods against these disciplined,trained Soviet students.Well,

**spk_2:** [27:53.06 - 28:26.06] that's exactly it.And this is what we've seen too in collecting all of Articles,ah,that were very,very fine,ah,report was done by a high school out in Colorado when the Soviet students came in,and one of them was really very,very nasty,and he said that we're going to,ah,your country will be communist,you know,in 10 years,and that they've been quite outspoken.Also in Maryland,one of the students said the same thing.And our students just look,Phyllis,if they don't even know what state they live in,if they don't even know what the Constitution is,

**spk_1:** [28:26.18 - 28:28.94] and they can't find the United States on a map of the world,

**spk_2:** [28:29.06 - 28:29.34] no.

**spk_1:** [28:30.50 - 28:38.46] I've talked to high school students who,who really disputed the existence of the Berlin Wall,and they didn't believe it existed.

**spk_2:** [28:38.93 - 28:41.30] Well,didn't they tell you that was your opinion?Yes,

**spk_1:** [28:41.46 - 28:42.48] right,they did.

**spk_2:** [28:43.02 - 28:54.50] That's right.So this,these exchanges are voluminous.I mean this is,is getting more and more.I'm sure we're not alone here in Maine,that we have not been selected out to be the ones who received

**spk_1:** [28:54.50 - 28:59.05] the Soviets.Well,if they're coming into Camden,Maine,what's the population of Camden?We have

**spk_2:** [28:59.64 - 29:01.61] 34,000 people.

**spk_1:** [29:01.93 - 29:05.81] Well,if they're coming in there,they must be coming in lots of places.Well,I'm sure they are.

**spk_2:** [29:05.92 - 29:10.41] We even have a Soviet ship off of Rockland,Maine,which is

**spk_1:** [29:10.69 - 29:19.89] all right.Well,we have,we do have to break for more announcements.Stand by,Charlotte and Anne.This is a fascinating subject.We'll carry on in a bit,and we

**spk_0:** [29:19.89 - 29:25.59] certainly will on the USA Radio Network.We will return with Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_7:** [29:35.83 - 30:37.07] A national panel reported that 25% of 17-year-olds are functional illiterates.Another 40% are marginal illiterates.That means nearly 2/3 of young Americans cannot read the daily newspaper,let alone books of history,literature,or science.What have they been doing all those years in public schools?Sex education,death education,new age meditation,and other non-academic psychological activities.This can be stopped.US law gives you,the parents,primary control over your children's education.Find out about your rights.Read the Education Reporter.It's a monthly newspaper from Eagle-Forum.The education reporter keeps you informed about offensive school curricula and about victories won by parents who assert their rights.Write for a free sample of the education reporter.The address Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.That's Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.

**spk_0:** [30:45.95 - 30:55.07] From the USA Radio Network,you're listening to Phil Schlaffly Live,and welcome back.Boy,Soviets influencing the public schools.This is fascinating.

**spk_1:** [30:55.42 - 31:22.82] It's amazing,isn't it,Bruce?We were talking to Anne Frazier in Roanoke Rapids,North Carolina.She's the one who worked with Dr.Charles Stanley to get a splendid resolution passed by the Southern Baptist Convention.Calling people's attention to this US-Soviet agreement and asking them to be on alert to counteract it when they find it,and I think you had one more thing to say about watching what is coming into state legislatures in the way of legislation.

**spk_6:** [31:23.95 - 31:47.13] Forums are organizing in various states and the citizens and taxpayers need to be alert to this.They need to follow the legislation and just spot it and alert the legislators not to fund the Carnegie report,uh,material and.And the legislation that they're calling for,the lead teacher is what they're referring to.

**spk_1:** [31:47.54 - 31:54.58] And you see this as an attempt by the Carnegie Foundation to really take over the direction of public schools.The teacher

**spk_6:** [31:54.58 - 32:05.16] certification to control the teachers who will enter the field,as well as they will move into testing and assessments too.So we just need to be alert to the whole program that Carnegie is doing.

**spk_1:** [32:05.30 - 32:10.18] Well,thank you very much.And we're going right to another guest,Betty Russinoff,

**spk_0:** [32:10.38 - 32:13.38] and she's on the line with us now from Detroit.Phyllis,are you there,

**spk_1:** [32:13.46 - 32:30.60] Betty?Yes I am.Betty Russinoff is one of the few people in the country who has actually had an article published on this issue we're discussing today,which is the US-Soviet agreements on developing curriculum for the public schools.Betty,how did you happen upon this subject?

**spk_2:** [32:31.14 - 32:43.45] Well,a friend of mine handed me a copy of the 41 page agreement.And said she was about to go into business for herself and,uh,you know,it was in my hands.So I recognized him.

**spk_1:** [32:43.72 - 32:49.30] Well,you must have some very well informed friends if they just hand you a copy of these 41 page agreement.

**spk_2:** [32:49.64 - 33:16.69] She's gotten this from the treaty officer of the State Department,I believe,and Uh,I,uh,left my job,I spent an entire month.Uh,Xeroxing copies of this agreement and getting them out around the country.I was fortunate to find a printer who,um,uh,recognized how important this agreement was,and he said if I provide the paper,he would do the copying for me.So that was a tremendous help.

**spk_1:** [33:16.93 - 33:25.08] Well,did you find a,a sort of a wall of Silence in the general media on this subject.So that's why you had to run to the print shop.Absolutely,absolutely.

**spk_2:** [33:27.51 - 34:01.79] A poll I conducted on my own reveals that practically no one knew about this agreement.In a conversation I had with an executive editor of a newspaper in Waterbury,Connecticut.About two years after the signing of the agreement in 1985,uh,I learned that he had not heard of the agreement,and I couldn't believe this because I said,but you're in the media.He said,Well,tell me about it.Uh,I did,and he said,if you'll send me all the background information,um,and write an op ed article,I'll see if I can get it published for you.And,uh,the article was published on May 6th,1988.

**spk_1:** [34:01.85 - 34:02.71] In what publication?

**spk_2:** [34:03.29 - 34:05.57] No,that is,it was,uh,published in 19.

**spk_1:** [34:06.56 - 34:09.40] Well,in,in what newspaper was it published?The Waterbury

**spk_2:** [34:09.40 - 35:13.08] Republican published on February 28th,1988,and I spoke of the secrecy,you know,surrounding the agreement called The Terrible Secret.And,um,uh,learned,uh,also that,um,uh,even people in the military had not heard of this agreement.Uh,one person,however,who is speaking out today.A retired US Army Brigadier general whose name is Andrew Gatsas,and here's a statement that he has made recently,I think it's terribly important for the American public to understand this.So the United States is providing the Soviets supercomputers,which they do not have,advancing their technology in exchange for Soviet software to be used in our computers in our schools with which to brainwash our children with the Marxist philosophy.Our children are taught what the Soviet children are taught,that is atheism and the communist form of government.Here's a military,a former military man who is very alarmed and is getting the word out,which is unfortunate because the watchdog media is not doing its job.

**spk_1:** [35:13.19 - 35:41.17] I think you're talking about General Andrew Gatsis,who was one of our combat heroes from World War II.Um,in any event,Betty,uh,tell us,um,have you encountered any of the conferences or the exchanges between the Soviets and the Americans?Um,have you,uh,uh,have you watched or observed or studied any of these?For example,wasn't there a conference in Alexandria,Virginia that you wrote about or studied,

**spk_2:** [35:41.42 - 36:01.93] and that was also surrounded by a great deal of secrecy.As a matter of fact,um,the FBI,um,uh,issued a report which was suppressed by Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead concerning the USSSR Citizens summit,uh,which the FBI called an active measures front.And I think

**spk_1:** [36:02.33 - 36:10.54] well that was a case where what something like 30 or 40 trained Russians came to meet with a comparable number of Americans.

**spk_2:** [36:10.85 - 36:42.90] It was larger than that,Phyllis,as a matter of fact.Magazine July 1988 issue.and the article was written by two pro correspondents and um they Um,To as a Russian landing party unquote and was Referred to by the US press,which called the Soviet Peace Committee delegation.Well,Betty,

**spk_1:** [36:42.95 - 37:08.97] tell us why,why do you think it is wrong for us to cooperate with the Russians on educational matters?Don't they see education as something very different from the way we see it?We look upon schools as having the function of educating children about the truth and historical facts and And,and math and science and so forth,but the Russians have an entirely different idea of education,don't they?You bet they do.

**spk_2:** [37:08.99 - 37:57.30] Uh,in a,um,an address delivered before the American Forum on Education and International Competence on May 16th,1988 in Saint Louis,Missouri,Chester Fenn stated.What,uh,do the Soviet youngsters learn about the United States?He said,Here are the conclusions of Indiana University Dean Howard Mellinger based on his recent examination of Soviet textbooks.Quote,the need to make history and geography fit a preordained analytical framework guides the choice of topics,the selection of evidence,and the decision about how events are to be interpreted.Attention is focused on the least attractive aspects of American life.Despite the material wealth enjoyed by many Americans,life in the United States is characterized by decadence,alienation,poverty,and misery.

**spk_1:** [37:57.60 - 38:32.76] And that's the,that's the statement of Chester Finn,who was a high official in the US Department of Education under William Bennett.In other words,he thinks,and I assume you think too,that the Russians are teaching their children a preordained view of the world in which the US is the bad guy.And everything is awful in the United States.I suppose they want to discourage defectors and make them think that everything is bad and violent over here.So what possible gain could there be for cooperating with the Soviets in developing curriculum for the public schools.

**spk_2:** [38:33.70 - 38:53.07] What's even worse is that Chester Fenn continues by saying,this is,that is the nature of education in the Soviet Union today,and the current reforms show few signs of altering it.Um,which is,you know,really tough.Uh,our youngsters should know this.Our educators should ponder its implications.And well,

**spk_1:** [38:53.11 - 39:12.39] I think it's a disgrace to call the Soviet system education at all.It really is brainwashing.And then when they deal with the with us,they plant their disinformation.Which is definitely planted falsehoods to make us believe wrong things.

**spk_2:** [39:12.59 - 39:35.73] Yes,and,um,at a March 3rd,1988 conference at the Hoover Institution,which was sponsored by the National Advisory Council on Educational Research and Improvement.A um speaker there,uh,speaks about the disinformation and this,again,is,you know,1988.after the agreement was signed in 1985

**spk_1:** [39:36.70 - 40:29.76] and Glasnost and perestroika have not made any change in this whatsoever.Well,we thank you very much,Betty Russov,for joining us today and sharing your information with us.We're talking today about the US-Soviet agreement that was signed in Geneva by our Secretary of State George Shultz and The Russian Foreign Minister Shevardnadze in November of 1985,which many of us didn't learn about till months after because as Mrs.Russinov has pointed out,there really has been a wall of silence in the media on this subject.Uh,there are not very many places you can read about it.You can read about it in the Phyllis Schlaffly report.We have an excellent report on that subject.And if you write in for our packet on this program,you'll be able to get a copy of the 41 page agreement.And if you want to verify with the State Department that it really was signed,you are certainly free to do so.

**spk_0:** [40:29.88 - 40:46.21] And our packet is only $10 and it's available to you,of course we'll have our address in just a few seconds here.Oh,and by.The way you might want to get a cassette copy of today's program because so many people like to review,Phyllis,what you've said.Your advice

**spk_1:** [40:46.21 - 40:54.49] we've had some very interesting guests today and some very interesting information that you probably will not hear on Dan Rather or Peter Jenny.

**spk_0:** [43:02.09 - 43:10.32] From the USA Radio Network,you're listening to Phyllis-Schlafly Live,and Phyllis,uh,another exciting segment yet to come.So let's go back out to Camden,

**spk_1:** [43:10.37 - 43:33.84] Maine and to.Iserbeat,a former US Department of Education official who is probably the best informed person in the country on the subject of the US-Soviet agreement signed in Geneva in 1975,excuse me,1985.Charlotte,I want to ask you,where's the money coming from?Where's the funding coming from for all these exchanges?Well,

**spk_2:** [43:33.97 - 44:14.34] it's coming from two sources,Phyllis.First,it's coming from our tax money.That's the United States Information Agency.And the Department of State,the National Endowment for the Humanities,they're pouring what I consider to be significant amounts of money into not only the exchanges but into some areas of curriculum development.The other.Major funding source are the tax exempt foundations,primarily the Carnegie Corporation that I understand has just put about a million dollars into the University of California for some research to be done out there in cooperation with the Soviet Union.And on,

**spk_1:** [44:14.35 - 44:19.21] on these two-way exchanges,Charlotte,I'm sure the Americans are paying for both ways.

**spk_2:** [44:19.42 - 44:41.16] Oh yes,and that's,that's a great bother to me.There are a lot of American students who can't even afford to go to college.And our tax money is paying for Soviet students to have their travel paid and their expenses while they're here to go to our universities,and this really bothers me enormously considering the fact that it's very tough for most American kids to go to college.

**spk_1:** [44:41.37 - 44:45.52] How do you know this money's being spent under the State Department and the USIA?

**spk_2:** [44:45.67 - 46:28.53] Well,because I requested information under the Freedom of Information Act.I had to pay quite a lot of money to get the grants,and I have all of this information in my office upstairs and it's,it's just disgusting.I mean,you get to the point where you,you,you don't want to look at it anymore.That's why it's upstairs and not with me now.But Phyllis,I have a,a very important document here from the National Academy of Education in Cambridge,Massachusetts,and that's fall 1987.It says,last fall.Scholars from the American Council of Learned Societies and the Ministry of Education of the Soviet Union met in the United States and agreed to establish a commission on education that will be responsible for joint scholarly relations in pedagogy,that's,you know,education and related fields between the US and the Soviet Union.Then it lists about 8 projects.One goes to Stanford University.That is methods of teaching and learning science and math.The other one goes to the University of Pittsburgh theory of teaching and learning,if you can believe it.This is cooperating with the Soviets in these things.Another one is development of students' creative abilities through artistic education.Stanford University,and the last one that concerns me is psychological and pedagogical problems of teaching in the development of preschool and school-age children.That goes to the psychology department,University of Utah,Salt Lake City.Now,those that I just read,that is,don't forget,that's not just to the American part.That is for joint studies under this new agreement that they have signed called,it's a commission on education.

**spk_1:** [46:29.36 - 47:01.06] Well,I think that's even much more ominous than the student exchanges because this goes to the matter of what is actually taught in our schools.Anybody who wants to know what the Soviet theory of learning is ought to read George Orwell's 1984.It's a,it's not a search for facts,knowledge,and truth.It's an imposition of brainwashing techniques on gullible little children.Do you see any other influences in the development of our curriculum?

**spk_2:** [47:01.34 - 48:24.93] Well,I definitely do.I mean,Pile of things right here.The Carnegie Group that I talked about earlier,they came away from Moscow with a new agreement.With the Institute on Problems of Informatics,that's computers,which would involve pilot experiments in Soviet and American classrooms.So the folks out there,if they think this isn't happening right now,it is.Then we had the textbook agreement.So the textbooks that their children will be having next year and the next year will,will have eliminated anything to do with the Soviet Union's brutal history since the revolution.Uh,now I have in front of me,we're always talking about critical thinking.That conference in Leningrad that they held,it was held last year in the United States,and this may be a result of it.I don't know.From an elementary school in Texas.I have something,a page.This is for 3rd grade on critical thinking,and it asks the children what is the first step you would take to solve each of these problems.They have a lot of problems.One is building good relations with the Soviet Union.The nuclear arms race.Then we have the latest thing is the National Science Teachers Association will publish a Soviet science magazine in the United States.Uh,this will be distributed free of charge to gifted and talented children in this country.So I can go on and on and on.

**spk_1:** [48:25.09 - 48:32.20] Well,Charlotte,we just have about a minute left.Would you tell our listeners what you think they can do about this subject that we've been discussing?

**spk_2:** [48:32.36 - 48:37.85] Well,I think it's very important that they write to their congressman first of all and say

**spk_1:** [48:37.85 - 48:38.19] what

**spk_2:** [48:38.60 - 49:27.29] and say that they would like to have the US-Soviet education agreements canceled and they would like to have an investigation of.Of tax exempt foundations in developing curriculum for our children with the Soviet Union.That's very important,and the funding should be.The funding definitely should be cut off.We have nothing to learn from the Soviet Union in regard to education in a so-called free society.We are supposed to be a free society,and they are not yet a free society.They still have millions of people in slave labor camps.The psychiatric wards are full of political dissidents,and this is absolutely ridiculous that we have to depend on them for help in developing curriculum for our children.

**spk_1:** [49:27.47 - 50:10.39] Well,just think how easy it would be for the schools to teach children about the Soviet Union by just simply buying a copy of Alexander Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago.Well,they can't read Phyllis.Well,we'll discuss that on another program.Well,thank you,thank you.Very much for joining us today,Charlotte Izerbe from Maine to discuss these agreements.I hope you will take her advice and write your congressman and ask him,well,he may not know about it in the first place.Ask him to send you a copy of the 41 page agreement signed by our State Department with the Soviet Union in Geneva in 1985.And then once you get it,ask your congressman to get it canceled because American schools have.Ting to learn by cooperating with the Russians.

**spk_0:** [50:10.47 - 50:33.42] And you're listening to perhaps America's foremost authority on what's happening in our public schools.That's Phyllis-Schlafly Live and on the USA Radio Network.The program is known as Phyllis-Schlafly Live.Phyllis,I'll be real interested to get your summary on this whole subject.Where are we and where are we going on the matter at hand.This is Phyllis-Schlafly Live.

**spk_9:** [50:44.50 - 51:40.94] The White House,1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,a place where the most powerful man in the world resides,the president of the United States.But what many Americans don't know is that some of our nation's most important decisions aren't made in the Oval Office.Because according to the Constitution,the power to make laws was granted only to Congress and not to the president.That's why only Congress can declare war,raise and support armies,and approve treaties.The bill is passed.The Constitution,the words we live by.To receive a free copy of this great document and information about it,write Constitution Washington DC 200063999.A message from the commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution and the Advertising Council

**spk_7:** [51:41.45 - 52:40.12] informing the public about real issues in education today.That's the job of Radio Live with Phyllis-Schlafly,but we need your help.Encourage your friends to listen to the program and thank this station for carrying it.Get your friends a cassette copy of this program.Give a subscription of the education reporter to your church or child's teacher,and don't forget about our packets that accompany information discussed on the program each week.Packets are available for $10 each on topics such as AIDS education,sex education,new age education,drug education,Quest,the NEA,and more.Send $5 for cassettes and $10 for packets to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois,62002.Remember to specify the date of the program and topic when you order.That's $5 for cassettes and $10 for packets to Eagle-Forum,Alton,Illinois 62002.

**spk_1:** [52:41.40 - 53:21.33] Today we've been talking about an agreement signed between the United States and the Soviet Union to cooperate in developing educational and teaching materials,textbooks,syllabi,curricula,educational films,documentary films,and other.Materials used in the US public schools.If you agree with us that there is no reason to cooperate with the Russians about what is taught to American children in the public schools,get a copy of this cassette and write your congressman and tell him to cancel this agreement.And then join us next week for another exciting program about what is going on inside the American public schools.

**spk_0:** [53:22.49 - 53:41.93] Phyllis-Schlafly Live on parents' rights and education presented by the USA Radio Network and by Eagle-Forum,a leading pro-family organization since 1972.Stay informed on what the public schools are teaching our children with Phyllis-Schlafly Live on parents' rights and education.
