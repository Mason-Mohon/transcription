Douglas Goldstein, CFP®, Financial Planner & Investment Advisor

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,200
Even informed citizens sometimes have a hard time getting through the fog of political

3
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,360
rhetoric to decide if government policies are good or bad. They can get a lot of help

4
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:59,040
from the writing of today's guest. He investigates the facts and examines similar policies, and

5
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:05,279
then he applies common sense and logic. Dr. Thomas Sowell is the author of more than 30

6
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:11,400
books, and we're going to talk today about his most recent book called Dismantling America,

7
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,800
which is a collection of columns that showcase his views on political, cultural, economic,

8
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,599
and legal issues. Welcome, Dr. Sowell, and tell us what is the meaning of the title of

9
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,599
your newest book.

10
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:32,559
I think that the current administration is doing more than simply passing policies that

11
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:36,919
are very questionable in themselves. What they're doing is changing the whole procedure

12
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:41,839
by which the American government operates, and I think that's going to do long-run damage

13
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:50,120
even if the policies themselves get repealed. For example, this practice of passing enormously

14
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,639
large and far-reaching bills without any opportunity for the public to know what's

15
00:01:55,639 --> 00:02:02,239
in them or, in some cases, for even most members of Congress to know what's in them. Things

16
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:08,639
like the waivers, for example, they can give to certain companies from the provisions of

17
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,559
the new health care law. Well, the ability to give waivers is the ability to withhold

18
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:20,520
waivers and, therefore, to punish people who dare to speak out. One insurance company

19
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,759
recently said that they were going to have to raise premiums because of the Obamacare

20
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:29,679
legislation. Well, they were immediately told by one of the Cabinet members that there will

21
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:36,679
be zero tolerance for what the administration calls misinformation, which is to say that

22
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,639
this insurance company can look for federal retaliation for having spoken the truth.

23
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:49,639
Well, isn't socialism not just spreading the wealth around? It's being able to spread

24
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:53,639
the wealth to your pals and make sure your friends get the goodies.

25
00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:59,039
Oh, absolutely. I mean, the administration, they're great at rhetoric. That's their strong

26
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,759
suit. And so they say they're against special interests, but that just means that their

27
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:06,639
special interests aren't called special interests.

28
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:13,639
Well, what do you think about Obama appointing all these czars who never had Senate confirmation?

29
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:19,039
Again, it's circumventing the Constitution and it's circumventing the public, because

30
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:24,240
the Constitution is the vehicle that allows the public to determine what kind of laws

31
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:28,839
they want to live under. And so if you can appoint people and call them czars instead

32
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:34,440
of Cabinet members, even though they may wield powers greater than the Cabinet members, if

33
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,559
you can do that, you've circumvented the Constitution. And then the Constitution can't

34
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:44,000
protect us unless we first protect the Constitution, that is, unless we vote against people who

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,919
circumvent the Constitution, even if the particular policy that they vote for may not be particularly

36
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,440
objectionable in themselves.

37
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,279
Well, why is anybody surprised Obama said that he wanted to fundamentally transform

38
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:01,440
the United States of America?

39
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,839
Well, I think no one believed that he meant what he was actually going to do. They may

40
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:12,679
have thought this was just some political rhetoric, but everything in the man's past

41
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:17,880
suggests that he is fundamentally opposed to the values and the procedures and the governing

42
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,200
principle to this country. And so now they're shocked to discover that he is what he's always

43
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,320
been, but wish they didn't bother to find out before voting.

44
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:36,200
We're talking today with Dr. Thomas Sowell about his new book, Dismantling America. And

45
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:44,440
he has, Obama has given us so many bad decisions. What's your comment about bailing out the

46
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,880
people who bought houses that they couldn't afford?

47
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,760
It's unbelievable. What is unbelievable is not that the government would do that, because

48
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,559
the government would do so many questionable things just for short-run political advantage.

49
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:06,480
What is incredible is there's so little criticism of it. When the obvious objection is, why

50
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:14,119
should I, who never owned a house until I was 50 years old, and have never owned a house

51
00:05:14,119 --> 00:05:18,399
that is as costly as some of these that we're bailing out, why should I have to pay for

52
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,239
these people who went ahead and bought a house that they couldn't afford?

53
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:26,720
That's right. That really annoys me as much as anything. My mother and father never owned

54
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,920
a house, and the idea that you'd be a better citizen if somebody induced you to buy a house

55
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:38,079
that you really couldn't afford is just an offensive idea.

56
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:45,600
That notion that housing determines behavior goes back well over a hundred years, and it

57
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,920
is defied over a hundred years of evidence to the contrary. It's certainly true that

58
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:58,679
if you find a neighborhood with nice houses, chances are it will have a lower crime rate,

59
00:05:58,679 --> 00:06:06,679
it will have better schools, and so forth. But this is the post-hoc fallacy. People of

60
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:10,959
a certain kind have certain kinds of houses, and they have certain kinds of educational

61
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:11,959
values.

62
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:17,720
We're talking today with Dr. Thomas Sowell, and you mention in the book that when you

63
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,519
were in your 20s, you were a little bit fascinated by the Marxist philosophy. What persuaded

64
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,519
you that private enterprise was better than the government running the economy?

65
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:35,279
Working for the government. You know, I was still a Marxist after I had taken a course

66
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:43,720
from Milton Friedman, but within three months of going to work for the government, I began

67
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,760
to change, because I realized that I was in the Labor Department, that government agencies

68
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:56,760
have their own priorities, and to expect them to carry out policies that benefit others,

69
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:02,279
when in fact their main purpose is to benefit themselves, is just very unrealistic.

70
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:07,000
What about the whole idea that if government runs it, such as healthcare, it's going to

71
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,880
cost less?

72
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,600
I don't know what the government runs that has ever cost less.

73
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,760
You think government coming into it is a major reason for the extraordinary rise in

74
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,160
tuition? You're on a college campus, and you...

75
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,640
Oh yes, my goodness. There have been studies that show for every dollar of government aid

76
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:33,640
to education, tuition rises by 50 cents. So when you start increasing government aid,

77
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,920
it's like a dog chasing its tail. I mean, he doesn't get any closer, no matter how fast

78
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
he runs.

79
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,440
Well, they've unfortunately sold a lot of people on this idea that the government running

80
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,200
healthcare is going to save us all money, as well as give us better health, and now

81
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:56,959
Obama's put a czar in front, who thinks the British system is really great.

82
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:02,839
Oh my goodness, I'm staggered, and I'm very disappointed in American media, because there's

83
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:08,760
so much in the British media about what is wrong with their medical system. I mean, the

84
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,880
women, for example, who have had their babies in British hospitals, not in the operating

85
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,720
room, but in elevators, and in the hallways, and so forth, because they get neglected to

86
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,720
the point where the baby's coming, and there's nobody there to take care of them.

87
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Well, I think the American people have caught on to what's wrong with Obamacare, because

88
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:37,799
I think Obama thought we were all going to like it after the law was passed, but it now

89
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,840
appears that the majority of the American people really do want to repeal it.

90
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:48,840
Well, I would even question whether he believed that, or whether he simply said that, because

91
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,039
if you really believe the people are going to like this after the law was passed, you

92
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:59,280
would have it go into effect certainly before the 2012 presidential election, and perhaps

93
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,919
before the 2010 congressional election. But in fact, the law was written to go into effect

94
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,799
after the 2012 election. So it's clearly, he felt that this was something that he wanted

95
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,280
to put in there, and whether the people like it or not, there won't be much they can do

96
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,159
about it if they'd only learn about it after he's been re-elected.

97
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:22,239
Thomas Sowell, our special guest, here on Ego Forum Live. Phyllis Schlafly is with you

98
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:29,239
24-7, of course, at EgoForum.org, and more of this conversation continues next.

100
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Eagle Forum Education Center in St. Louis is the headquarters of Eagle Forum's many educational activities.

101
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The center houses a large library of 20th century American history, a unique collection of DVDs and CDs, and extraordinary archives.

102
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Eagle Forum's publications include Education Reporter, bringing you important news about parents' rights and public school curriculum.

103
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Eagle Forum sponsors activities especially for college students and for Teen Eagles,

104
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
including an annual Collegians Leadership Summit held each summer in Washington, D.C.

105
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Eagle Forum sponsors two radio series.

106
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Phyllis Schlafly's three-minute commentaries heard daily on 550 stations, and this Saturday live call-in program now heard on 75 stations.

107
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Both broadcasts are streamed on the Internet at eagleforum.org.

108
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Eagle Forum, a conservative organization of dedicated Americans, invites you to visit our website at eagleforum.org.

109
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You've probably heard that all public schools are mandated to give reading tests, and many parents are worrying whether their children will pass.

110
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If you want to find out if your child's reading skills are all they should be, we invite you to give Eagle Forum's first reading test in the privacy of your own home.

111
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Any child who has finished first grade should be able to pass this test.

112
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It will enable you to find out if your child can really read or if he has been taught to memorize a few dozen frequently used words

113
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and then just guess at other words from the pictures on the page.

114
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Eagle Forum's simple test will tell you whether your child is really reading.

115
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't let your child fall behind in school because he is a poor reader.

116
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Call 1-800-700-5228 and ask for our free reading test.

117
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's 1-800-700-5228.

118
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And you can see Eagle Forum's first reading test on the website TurboReader.com.

119
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Look up the website www.turboreader.com.

120
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Just about every week, Phyllis Schlafly takes questions and comments, but this week, Phyllis is going the full hour with her special guest, Tarma Sol.

121
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Eagle Forum Live continues. Here again, Phyllis Schlafly.

122
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We're talking today with Dr. Tarma Sol of the Hoover Institution in California,

123
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
and I want to switch the subject a little bit to education.

124
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I know you write on that in many of your books, and the misuse of words.

125
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
For example, now they're trying to tell us that national standards are the way to go,

126
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and, of course, the word social justice has become very trendy in the schools.

127
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tell us what that really means.

128
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I must confess at the outset that it's totally beyond my ability to tell you what that phrase means

129
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
because I have read books going back 100 years, and nobody has ever defined it.

130
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I guess what they have in mind is that all sorts of groups ought to be equally represented in all sorts of places,

131
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:24,000
which is particularly amazing to me after having spent decades studying ethnic and other groups around the world.

132
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Nowhere on this planet do I find groups that are the same.

133
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If black and white Americans, for example, were the same, they would be the only two groups on this planet that are the same.

134
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I mean, the Northern Italians and Southern Italians aren't the same.

135
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The Scottish Lowlanders and the Scottish Highlanders aren't the same.

136
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
People in North Korea are not the same as people in South Korea.

137
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I mean, you can go through everywhere you go that there are different groups.

138
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You find incredible differences.

139
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You find differences in alcoholism rates, infant mortality rates.

140
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You name it, there are differences.

141
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And yet, so many of our policies and even our court decisions are based on the notion that if all the groups aren't the same in some respect,

142
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
somebody else must be to blame.

143
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And, well, I think social justice in many cases has come to mean teaching the kids that they live in an unjust, oppressive, racist society.

144
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, yes.

145
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And, therefore, they must organize under some community organizer and take power and wealth away from people who have it.

146
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, absolutely, absolutely.

147
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You know, it's funny, Dr. Sowell, not only have some of these words become bad,

148
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
but it's funny the way the White House recognizes that the word stimulus has become a negative word

149
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
because people don't believe the stimulus spending did stimulate any jobs, at least in private industry.

150
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Well, I think that most of the evidence would justify substituting the word sedative for stimulus.

151
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I've done some research on this, and you can trace the banks on which the government dumped great sums of money

152
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and discover that the following year they made substantially fewer loans than they made the previous year.

153
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And, similarly, in other areas where they've dumped all this money and the money just sits there.

154
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I mean, right now, both the banks and private industry, as well as individuals, have more money sitting idle than they have had in decades.

155
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, I think the money that did get spent got spent to create more government jobs.

156
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, absolutely.

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Not private enterprise jobs.

158
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No, and the great problem is that the various policies of the administration are making it more difficult to create private industry jobs.

159
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And the government jobs that they create, obviously the government doesn't create any wealth,

160
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
so they take the wealth out of the private economy, use it to create the government jobs.

161
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But, of course, that means the private economy has less money to create jobs than they had before.

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And so there's no net increase in jobs.

163
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I wish, Dr. Sowell, you'd talk a little bit about your views about immigration

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and how we used to assimilate the immigrants into our society, but they're not doing that now.

165
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And we hope that we would be a great country.

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I saw Marco Rubio saying on television that his father was a bartender and his wife was a waitress.

167
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
His mother was a waitress.

168
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And it was such a great country.

169
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Now he's running for the Senate.

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And America's such a great country where this can happen.

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He pointed out how that absolutely could not happen in the Cuba that he came from.

172
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, absolutely.

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And Obama doesn't believe we're an exceptional, unique country.

174
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Not at all.

175
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And heaven knows he should have more reason than most people to be glad he was born here.

176
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're right about the immigrants.

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I mean, people point out how all these millions of European immigrants were integrated into society and so on.

178
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's true.

179
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But it's also true that most of these groups did so by making great efforts,

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
sometimes individual and sometimes organized efforts, to assimilate to the American society.

181
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Today, not only is that not happening in the organizational sense,

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
the organizations that exist to represent different groups, such as La Raza, for example,

183
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
are doing their best to keep the foreigners foreign.

184
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And these activists have such gall that they have even opposed letting the parents of children,

185
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
that is, the Hispanic parents of Hispanic children, decide whether they want the kids taught in English or Spanish

186
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
because they know the parents want their children taught in English.

187
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Because that's how they'll get ahead.

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I remember, actually it was during the Bush administration,

189
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I tried to get Congress to say that the use of the bilingual education money coming from the federal government would be parents' option.

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well, everybody was against that.

191
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
They didn't want parents to have the option.

192
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's right.

193
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Well, you know, this is part of the general arrogance that extends far beyond this issue.

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
They want to be able to decide what is right and, to the extent possible, cut the ordinary people out of the loop.

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I mean, that's why these bills were passed in such a hurry.

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Even when they're bills, they won't take place until years later.

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So it's not like they're hurrying to get the thing in operation.

198
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's like they're hurrying to get it passed before the rest of us can find out.

199
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And that really permeates everything that they say and do.

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Well, Nancy Pelosi was even pretty frank about that.

201
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
She said, we have to pass the bill and then you'll find out what's in it.

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's right.

203
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And that is the attitude.

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So many people think of the left as being for the common man.

205
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I've been on the left.

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I've studied the left.

207
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The left is for the left making the decisions and having those decisions handed down to the rest of us

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
where we can like it or love it.

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:23,000
One of the things that I find really disturbing about President Obama is the way he wants to bow to world opinion

210
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
and apologize for us around the world.

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I know you've had a number of columns on that covered in your book, Dismantling America, which is a wonderful new book.

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Comment on that.

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We want to maintain our individual identity as the land of freedom and prosperity.

214
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Absolutely.

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But again, this is a man who I don't believe has any faith in America as it is

216
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and who thinks our only redeeming feature is that we can elect people like him to change us to what he thinks we ought to be.

218
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
And I think this is part of that.

219
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:12,280
Dinesh D'Souza has argued that he really has a sort of third-world mentality of envy and

220
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:18,320
resentment of the United States, and my feeling is very much the same, that this is not a

221
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,280
man who loves this country, this is not a man who's dedicated to his values.

222
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:29,879
And it's incredible to me that the American people could have elected such a man to the

223
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:37,680
high office he has, which means he holds really our lives in his hands, not only without knowing

224
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,119
what he was like from his track record, but disregarding what they do know about his past,

225
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,560
in order to invest him with what they imagine to be his good qualities.

226
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,720
Well, he led a privileged life in our country, he never had a real job.

227
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
Yeah.

228
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:58,959
He talked about all these shovel-ready jobs, he never handled any shovels.

229
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:10,120
You know, this goes beyond Obama, but one of the things that has amazed me is that people

230
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:18,160
who were born in very humble circumstances have so often been so dedicated to this country,

231
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,680
and people who are given all sorts of privileges, including millionaires, have turned against

232
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
this.

233
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,160
You know, right after 9-11, when all these American flags were flying in various neighborhoods

234
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,919
and homes and other places, I went out to the University of California at Berkeley,

235
00:01:35,919 --> 00:01:39,959
and on that entire campus I did not see one American flag flying.

236
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:44,559
The first American flag that I saw was on my way back from Berkeley, when I was passing

237
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:48,800
through a low-income black neighborhood in Oakland.

238
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,800
That's where I first saw an American flag flying.

239
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,919
What do you think would happen if we actually enforced our laws against illegal immigration?

240
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,559
Would our crops rot in the field?

241
00:01:59,559 --> 00:02:04,160
We won't be able to eat strawberries anymore, and the chicken plants will go out of business?

242
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,440
Do you know, what gets me is that we have had chronic agricultural surpluses that cost

243
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,119
the taxpayers billions of dollars every year.

244
00:02:15,119 --> 00:02:21,839
And so even if agricultural output went down, there isn't a slight danger that we'd be without

245
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:24,160
strawberries or anything else.

246
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:35,160
Well, I think the two political parties do cooperate in winking their eyes at this illegal

247
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
immigration.

248
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:44,199
You know, they've now admitted that the fence, the virtual fence, was a billion-dollar mistake.

249
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,199
It won't work at all.

250
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,880
Well, I don't think it was a mistake from their standpoint.

251
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:53,320
It got the political pressure off them, and it was worth it to spend a billion dollars

252
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,039
worth of the taxpayers' money for that.

253
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,839
I'm not at all convinced that they ever thought at the outset that this thing was going to

254
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:02,839
work.

255
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:07,720
Well, one of our congressmen, the one from Iowa, Steve King, who was in the construction

256
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:15,240
business before he had a real job, before he went to Congress, I saw him on C-SPAN showing

257
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,080
how he would build a fence, and how he would pour the concrete, and how he'd put the blocks

258
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,080
in.

259
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,759
And he had a model, and it looked pretty simple.

260
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,360
We could hire some of those people to build the fence.

261
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,800
You know, it's not like building a fence is not some unprecedented problem.

262
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,360
It's not rocket science?

263
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
No.

264
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:41,119
I mean, you know, I've seen the Berlin Wall, I saw the fence between China and Hong Kong

265
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:43,919
before Hong Kong became part of China.

266
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:48,559
You just don't get over those kinds of fences, because they're serious about stopping you.

267
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:55,479
Now, if you're going to have a fence where you can easily run up the side of the fence

268
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,759
and bolt right on over, well, of course it's not going to be very effective.

269
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:03,399
But that doesn't mean there are no effective fences.

270
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:08,119
If there were no effective fences, the entire population of Eastern Europe would probably

271
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:10,960
have moved to Western Europe during the year of the Soviet Union.

272
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,440
Good point.

273
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,399
Today, Phyllis Schlafly and her special guest Thomas Sowell are prerecorded.

274
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,119

Recent issues on education include how to train our leaders to be conservative, the

282
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:23,399
radical resolutions passed by the National Education Association, and liberal plans to

283
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,839
subvert the U.S. Constitution.

284
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,619
Other reports cover such vital topics as what's happening on college campuses, how the public

285
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:35,920
schools are turning out liberals, the rising costs of tolerating illegal aliens, and Congress

286
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,320
must curb activist judges.

287
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,440
The Phyllis Schlafly Report is the best bargain in print.

288
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,440

Are you concerned about border security or about the effect that millions of illegal

294
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,779
aliens are having on illegal drugs, crime, disease, and health care costs?

295
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:12,380
These are only some of the many subjects of national importance covered in the Phyllis

296
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,720
Schlafly Report, a monthly newsletter Phyllis has been writing for 42 years.

297
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,179
The Phyllis Schlafly Report covers a lot of other subjects too, such as education, both

298
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:28,859
public school and college, court cases, family and feminism, health care, and United Nations

299
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:29,859
treaties.

300
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:34,000
The Phyllis Schlafly Report always gives you more facts and fewer words than anything

301
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,100
in print.

302
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,380

307

Next week, of course, EgoForum Live returns to its regular format where we take questions

308
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,859

Now, once again, Phyllis Schlafly.

311
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:35,540
We're talking today with Dr. Thomas Sowell, and I know that you know what's going on with

312
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,220
the universities.

313
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:44,820
Do you see a change in the student body now from what it was when you started out teaching

314
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,820
in colleges?

315
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:50,940
Well, I haven't actually taught in about the last 30 years, but I think that's not...

316
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,220
But I obviously did see some changes, because I really...

317
00:07:54,220 --> 00:08:00,500
I started my academic career to be a teacher, not to be a writer and researcher.

318
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,700
But I saw enough changes between the time I first started in 1962 and in 1980, when

319
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,500
I taught my last class, that I realized that this was just no longer where I wanted to

320
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
be.

321
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,100
Well, they haven't read much of anything.

322
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,579
They don't know much history.

323
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:19,220
Oh, my gosh, no.

324
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,700
You can't presuppose anything in teaching, because, well, at least of all history, there

325
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
are all sorts of places.

326
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:30,739
I mean, we're talking prestigious places where you can graduate without a clue about the

327
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:32,219
history of this country.

328
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:38,380
Yes, I understand there's one California university where you can fulfill the history requirement

329
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,299
by taking a course in the history of rock and roll.

330
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:42,299
Yes.

331
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:48,099
Well, there are all kinds of these sort of boutique courses in highly specialized things,

332
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:52,539
and they're very easy for the professors to teach, because the professor does a doctoral

333
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:55,780
dissertation on the history of winemaking in France.

334
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,340
Well, he has a ton of material.

335
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:02,419
It's far easier for him to teach a course on the history of winemaking in France than

336
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:07,219
to teach a course on the history of Europe or on the history of the United States.

337
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:13,380
Dr. Sowell, we've been talking about the great variety of subjects you deal with in your

338
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,700
latest book, Dismantling America, but I have to tell you, my favorite one of your books

339
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,179
is your one about intellectuals, and I have to ask you to give some of your choice remarks

340
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:28,820
of what you think about intellectuals and their influence on our society.

341
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,059
Well, the influence is the easiest to summarize.

342
00:09:32,059 --> 00:09:34,780
I think it has been largely negative.

343
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:38,979
They have been part of this process which really set the stage for the dismantling of

344
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:39,979
America.

345
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:44,140
They've been enormously critical of everything that has happened in this country.

346
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,700
They've taken the sins of the human race, which are common around the world, and they've

347
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,500
talked about them as if they're the peculiarities of our society, of virtually everything bad

348
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,940
that has gone on in the history of this country has gone on to a worse extent.

350
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
both other countries around the world

351
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,340
uh... and yet you never look you never learn any of that

352
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:09,120
uh... my gosh uh... one one of the thing they love to talk about a slavery

353
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,320
united states

354
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,840
well and well i said let's say talk about all the time

355
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:14,800
you would think

356
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,680
that the only people who were ever in slave were blocked when played by white

357
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,459
in the united states or at most

358
00:00:20,459 --> 00:00:22,080
in european society

359
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,639
uh... neither i think most of the slaves in the history of the world would be the

360
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:26,920
black-and-white

361
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,639
they were the people who were conquered in war weren't they

362
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:34,160
they were they were people who were who were uh... abducted by pirates

363
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,000
uh... there was slavery every everywhere you found human being

364
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,439
you found slavery

365
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:41,240
uh... i mean

366
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,639
there was a time not that many centuries ago when people could not

367
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:47,160
conceive of a world without slavery

368
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,020
i mean that the the uh... christian monasteries in europe

369
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,799
the buddhist monasteries in asia had slaves

370
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,520
uh... even in the uh... ideal society in the novel utopia

371
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,360
utopia had slaves they couldn't even conceive of

372
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,720
of even an ideal society without slaves

373
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,839
uh... what was peculiar about the united states about western civilization

374
00:01:07,839 --> 00:01:11,860
was that this was the first and for a long time the only civilization

375
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,339
that turned against it

376
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,680
and destroyed it

377
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,099
but that we never hear

378
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:20,760
well this thing about uh... crying about uh... past uh...

379
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,080
past sins

380
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,680
uh... you know i uh... spent

381
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,040
ten years of my life fighting the equal rights amendment and i can tell you how

382
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,120
many times i was in a debate

383
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,879
uh... before uh... legislative hearing or elsewhere

384
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,000
and my opponent is still crying about the time when women didn't have the

385
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,599
right to vote in this country

386
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:43,000
now at my advanced age i don't even know anybody who can remember that time

387
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,279
but they're still whining about it

388
00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:47,820
oh yeah and the other thing too is that

389
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,480
a great injustice to your ancestors is not necessarily a great injustice to you

390
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,160
uh... if you look at the history of western europe and western europe became

391
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,400
illiterate

392
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,760
because the romans conquered it now nobody considered the romans

393
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,440
sweethearts

394
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,959
i mean they slaughtered people by the thousands they oppressed the people they

395
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,480
conquered

396
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,559
and so forth

397
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,320
but the net result

398
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,520
well for today's western europeans

399
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,399
is that their society has got a huge advantage over eastern europe

400
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:16,639
because their languages for example

401
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,800
uh... had roman letters

402
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,919
centuries before the languages of eastern europe

403
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,639
uh... had letters

404
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,360
and and and and and you see that reflected to this day

405
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,119
i think quite similarly here in the united states

406
00:02:28,119 --> 00:02:30,440
uh... there's no question that people who were

407
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,160
brought in bondage to africa from africa here to be mistreated and so forth

408
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,559
they suffered a lot

409
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:39,679
but of course the reason the black population of the united states is the most

410
00:02:39,679 --> 00:02:42,000
prosperous black population in the world

411
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,119
was because of the injustices done to our ancestors

412
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:49,039
uh... we're talking today with doctor thomas seoul

413
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,720
uh... let me ask you this question

414
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,800
all the polls show that self-identified conservatives

415
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,520
outnumber liberals

416
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,600
self-identified liberals about two to one

417
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,039
uh... but yet we've elected the most left-wing president in history that

418
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,520
doesn't make sense how did that happen

419
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,080
i think uh... and and and and and and a few words

420
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,839
the ineptness of the republican party

421
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:16,919
i mean it's like it's like it's like when you're dealt the high cards in the

422
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,679
game

423
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:21,960
and your opponent wins it

424
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,800
well that's that's that's the way it is well we we uh...

425
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,000
we hope that the elections are going to change that because

426
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,960
uh... the remedies i think the remedies for our problems are there in the

427
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,399
constitution

428
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:35,720
absolutely

429
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,479
and uh... that's uh... apparently the liberals are very much annoyed when

430
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,919
tea-partiers

431
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,559
uh... hold up copies of the constitution and say we have to get back to the

432
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,500
constitution but that's really what we do need to do

433
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:50,979
absolutely because that's really what enables us

434
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:53,380
to be a self-governing country

435
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,139
and freedom

436
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:57,779
again back to uh... foreign policy

437
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:02,619
uh... you seem very concerned about iran getting nuclear bombs

438
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:04,080
what about that

439
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,820
i can't understand why other people aren't

440
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,460
i mean after nine eleven what we understand what the terrorists alike

441
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,979
uh... to think of those same people who did nine eleven as having nuclear

442
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:16,179
weapons

443
00:04:16,179 --> 00:04:18,140
all of them that show

444
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,500
uh... through the through uh... through every american

445
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,679
and the other thing is we it's not like a soviet having nuclear weapons

446
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:30,540
because the soviet whatever their fault were not suicidal

447
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,940
and they knew that they bomb new york we would wipe moscow off the face of the

448
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,940
earth

449
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,619
the people in iran don't care about people who run iran the people who live

450
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:39,579
back here

451
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:43,640
the people who are who have dictatorial power in iran often addicts

452
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,279
and if they if they if they can wipe out uh...

453
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:50,480
new york in chicago in los angeles and we we wipe out their on

454
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,760
their they've got their come out ahead of the game as far as they're concerned

455
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,600
well they teach that suicide is great that you can have them

456
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,959
but that's right so i mean you can't you cannot just

457
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,320
deter suicide bombers

458
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,399
and and so suicide bombers with nuclear weapons are just the most frightening

459
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,480
thing in the world

460
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,359
do you think that uh...

461
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:17,359
uh... what obama's doing is taking us into uh... european-style socialism

462
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,519
and why is that so awful

463
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,359
well among that will provide all of the year to go to all things are wrong with

464
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:25,480
european-style socialist but they don't have

465
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,640
they've they typically have higher unemployment rates than we do

466
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,959
unemployment that last longer than we do

467
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,200
their medical systems run by government are far far inferior to ours

468
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,320
and so on

469
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,679
uh... but i think the thing that really is the point of no return is a nuclear

470
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:41,920
iran

471
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,559
because uh...

472
00:05:43,559 --> 00:05:47,359
it took only two bombs for japan to surrender after at the end of world war

473
00:05:47,359 --> 00:05:48,399
two

474
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,200
i think the japanese were a lot tougher than than we are now

475
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,160
i do not see this country doing anything other than surrendering

476
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,959
i mean it may be

477
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,839
inconceivable to most people

478
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,040
that the united states would ever surrender

479
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,000
but it was inconceivable that japan would surrender it had never surrendered

480
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,880
in this whole history

481
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,119
and yet just those two bombs did it

482
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,799
iraq the fact that we may have

483
00:06:12,799 --> 00:06:14,600
you know a hundred bomb

484
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,880
or hundred times as many bombs as iran

485
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,399
means absolutely nothing if they're willing to die and we're not

486
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:25,320
uh... you do uh... make an interesting note that liberals are generally more

487
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:29,239
articulate in putting forth their policies and conservatives

488
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:33,519
so they come up with all these uh... smart phrases that sound good

489
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,880
do you have any advice for conservatives who want to do a better job of

490
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,040
communicating other than passing around your books of course

491
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,920
i think

492
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,200
uh... one of these you first have to have to

493
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,119
know that

494
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,679
being articulate

495
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:51,000
uh... is important in politics

496
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,839
uh... i i'm i'm appalled at how little uh... effort and thought republicans

497
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:58,040
seem to put into what they what they

498
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,079
say during election campaign

499
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,040
i would move up all uh... you know i think of bob dole

500
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,320
having forty five minutes on the air and just

501
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,559
further getaway

502
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,839
not addressing any of the problem

503
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,000
uh...

504
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,679
that you you can't do something unless you know what it is you want to do

505
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:18,399
and i think that's one of the things ought to be the top of the list but i

506
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,720
think those find that they're improving

507
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,480
thomas all our special guest here on eagle forum live phyllis schlafly is

508
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,040
with you twenty four seven of course it ego forum dot org

509
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:36,040
and more of this conversation continues

510
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:43,040
and

511
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,600
the biggest scandal in education today is allowing children to be promoted from

512
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,720
grade to grade and even graduate from high school

513
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,880
without ever learning how to read

514
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,600
school should teach kids how to read in the first grade by a real phonics method

515
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,519
parents can be easily fooled because first graders are able to memorize a few

516
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,399
dozen one-syllable words

517
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,119
and then the books use those same words over and over again

518
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:26,119
how can you tell if your child is really reading or if he's just reciting a few

519
00:08:26,119 --> 00:08:28,760
words he's memorized and guessing at others

520
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,679
phyllis schlafly has developed a simple reading test you can use at home to find

521
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,080
out whether your child can actually read or is just guessing at the words

522
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,320
make sure your son or daughter has every chance to succeed don't leave it up to

523
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,960
the schools to teach your child this vital skill

524
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,320
order your free reading test by calling one eight hundred seven hundred five two

525

children will be living in

529
00:09:03,239 --> 00:09:07,280
do you think that one person cannot make a difference so why bother to write your

530
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,840

persuading them to vote for good policies after they are elected it's

543
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,280
Welcome back to Ego Forum Live, this is Phyllis Schlafly and we're continuing with the great

544
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:23,320
economist Thomas Sowell explaining why Republicans are often very inarticulate in explaining

545
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,360
what they want to do.

546
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:31,639
I remember back during the 1994 government shutdown when the plain fact was that the

547
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:36,759
Republican Congress had voted more money than the government had had before, and so there

548
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:39,560
was no shortage of money to run the government.

549
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:44,799
And yet when Clinton began pushing the idea that Republicans caused the government to

550
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,840
shut down by not giving them enough money, the Republicans came on the air and they started

551
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,080
talking about OMB statistics versus CBO statistics.

552
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,599
Well, good heavens, man, you need to come on the air and say, no, we gave them the money.

553
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:01,400
He chose not to do it and he's lying.

554
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,040
I mean, people can understand that.

555
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,040
But if you want to go all around Washington and speak, you can't expect the public to

556
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,400
understand what you're talking about.

557
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,919
Well, I remember meeting with the Republican leadership at that time and and I said, well,

558
00:01:16,919 --> 00:01:22,440
what is your plan B if Clinton doesn't do what you expect?

559
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,160
And they didn't have any plan B.

560
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,480
I want to ask you another question.

561
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:37,279
We want more transparency, as Obama said, but we some people have urged that all

562
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:42,199
congressional hearings and court proceedings and arguments be televised.

563
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:44,519
But you don't think that's a helpful idea, right?

564
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:50,480
No, if I if I if I had my way, I would cut out the C-SPAN coverage of of Congress.

565
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,199
These these are these are staged events.

566
00:01:53,199 --> 00:02:00,440
These these are not sort of candid camera kinds of looks at how Congress is working.

567
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,519
The Congress, the people in Congress know that the cameras on and they behave and say

568
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:08,720
things in front of the camera that have nothing to do with what they're going to do when

569
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,119
they make their backroom deal.

570
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,759
And so this is a charade for the sake of the public.

571
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:21,479
Well, and I don't think people would get much out of the arguments before the courts

572
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,960
either. I kind of agree with you on that, especially there, because unless you know

573
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,559
the legal framework, you have no idea.

574
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:32,800
I mean, especially in appellate court, I mean, maybe a trial court, you could figure

575
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,199
out who's guilty and who's innocent.

576
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,000
But an appellate court is not not not taking that, not making that decision.

577
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,119
They're deciding whether the rules of the game were played when this trial was held.

578
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,679
And unless you happen to know what the procedure should have been, you have no way of

579
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:51,039
knowing whether what was done was good, bad or indifferent.

580
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:58,039
Well, you talk about need need some clever words to describe some of these people who

581
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:59,559
are destroying our heritage.

582
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:05,360
My word for the judges is supremacist because they really think they really do think

583
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,160
they're supreme over the other branches of government and and the people.

584
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:09,960
What about that?

585
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,360
But tragically, they are so long as nobody objects.

586
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:23,960
I mean, would you would you agree with me that that the founding fathers plan for the

587
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:28,919
judiciary to be the least powerful branch of government, but the judges have made it

588
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,479
the most powerful because they're deciding all these major issues?

589
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:33,880
Oh, absolutely.

590
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:41,279
Oh, there's a judge who decided that firefighters can't be promoted in New York

591
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:45,720
because they don't have the right demographic mix of people who pass the test.

592
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:51,440
Now, no one gave him that power, but unless someone challenges it, you know, people like

593
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,639
that are not going to stop unless they get stopped.

594
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:58,839
And yet the idea has gotten out there to be against judges is to be against the rule of

595
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:02,559
law. Well, the rule of law was never meant to be simply the rule of judges.

596
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:08,399
You have another interesting book called Economic Facts and Fallacies.

597
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,360
What are these a couple of these fallacies that people have fallen for?

598
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:13,679
Oh, my heavens.

599
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,600
There there there is the notion that.

600
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:24,320
Oh, I guess tax cuts for the rich are one of those that when the when the taxes are

601
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,799
cut, the benefits benefits go simply to the rich.

602
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,320
And of course, there's a lot of confusion between tax rates and tax revenues.

603
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:36,160
Tax rates can go down and tax while tax revenues go up.

604
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,559
And in fact, many of the tax rate cuts beginning in the 1920s and during the Kennedy

605
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:46,720
administration, Reagan and Bush administrations have, in fact, brought in more

606
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,720
revenue to the federal government because people no longer keep their money in tax

607
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,920
shelters. They invested in the economy and that then caused the economy to grow and the

608
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,000
government to make more taxes to collect more tax revenues, even though the rate of

609
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,320
taxation has been lowered.

610
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:02,279
But you never hear that.

611
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,000
You hear that as tax cuts for the rich.

612
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,279
Well, back to your one of your favorite subjects, the what's the matter with the

613
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:15,200
intellectuals isn't one of the additional things that matter with them is that there's

614
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:21,119
no there's no punishment in the in the whole system when they make wrong decisions

615
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,920
and encourage bad policies.

616
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,200
Oh, absolutely.

617
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,320
You can advocate policies, as was done in France in the 30s, that end up undermining

618
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,440
the nation's national defense so that France, which had fought for four long years

619
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,920
against the German invaders during the First World War, collapsed after six weeks of

620
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,320
fighting in the Second World War.

621
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:46,239
But but there's no intellectual who could be punished for that.

622
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,440
That was just one of the things that happened.

623
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:53,480
And certainly academics can't be punished if they turn out people from from the

624
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,160
universities who graduate not understanding of the history of the country, the nature

625
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,720
of constitutional government or any of the other things that they need in order to be

626
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,600
decent citizens.

627
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:07,799
Well, if you build a fence and it falls down, I guess you can be sued for faulty work.

628
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:12,239
Yeah, but it's virtually impossible to sue an intellectual for faulty work.

629
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,760
You can't even fire a faculty member who advocates policies that produce financial

630
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,799
ruin for the college.

631
00:06:19,119 --> 00:06:21,559
You, of course, are an economist.

632
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:28,040
What do you think about Nixon saying we're all Keynesians now?

633
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,760
And I understand that the the British now have specifically rejected Keynesianism.

634
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,320
Oh, heavens. I think a lot of people have rejected it.

635
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:44,000
When when Obama was president elect, he was saying that we all know that we have to

636
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,600
spend more and concord with Keynesian theories.

637
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:51,079
A group of a large number of economists, in fact, took out full page ads, many of them by

638
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:56,320
economists with Nobel Prizes in economics saying, no, we don't have to do that.

639
00:06:56,679 --> 00:07:03,040
But no, unfortunately, Richard Nixon would say almost anything if it was politically

640
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,959
expedient. One question we hadn't gotten around to is what do you think about the

641
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:09,720
danger of the Muslims today?

642
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,480
Very great danger and what is more dangerous.

643
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:20,959
Is that we dare not speak it as that one Williams discovered recently on NPR, but in

644
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:26,279
many of the countries of Europe, merely to warn about the dangers from the extremists

645
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:31,480
among the Muslims is to court being prosecuted under hate speech laws.

646
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:37,959
I mean, I think that that sort of thing will undoubtedly come to this country if Obama

647
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,920
gets a second term.

648
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:45,559
Well, whatever happened to all this diversity, people were one of the other

649
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:46,679
fraudulent words.

650
00:07:47,679 --> 00:07:54,160
Diversity on a college campus means black leftist, white leftist, female leftist and

651
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,119
Hispanic leftist.

652
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,239
I mean, that's diversity, but diversity of ideas.

653
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:05,079
And after all, the university exists for ideas, not not for demographic representation,

654
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,679
but but diversity of ideas is virtually unknown at most of the college and university

655
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:11,679
campus in the country.

656
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:20,760
You have so many important books, which one would you recommend for the general public?

657
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,160
You do have a very big you have a book that has basic in the title.

658
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,799
It's basic economic economics.

659
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes, it's it's it's the one that has sold the most copies here and has been translated

660
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,799
into the most languages overseas.

661
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:42,400
And it gives people a basic understanding of what economics are all about.

662
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:46,400
Yes, without without graphs, without equations and without jargon.

663
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,159
How about without math?

664
00:08:49,239 --> 00:08:50,239
How about math?

665
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:51,919
No math, no math.

666
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,200
So there's one there's one arithmetic example.

667
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,960
But if you if you can master addition and subtraction, you're home free.

668
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,559
We've certainly had an interesting conversation with Dr.

669
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,200
Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institution.

670
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,719
He's written many books.

671
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,080
I recommend them all.

672
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,880
His latest book is called Dismantling America.

673
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:24,559
It's a lot of his common sense logic to explain what's going on in language that the

674
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,280
average voter can understand.

675
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,599
I recommend it highly.

676
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:34,000
Also, his other books, the one on intellectuals and society and the one on basic

677
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,760
economics. Thank you so much, Dr.

678
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,359
Sowell, for being with us today.

679
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:39,840
We appreciate your time.

680
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,520
Keep up the good work.

681
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,479
Keep writing.

682
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,239
Thank you very much for having me.

683
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:49,080

Eagle Forum Education Center in St. Louis is the headquarters of Eagle Forum's many educational activities.

690
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The center houses a large library of 20th century American history, a unique collection of DVDs and CDs, and extraordinary archives.

691
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Eagle Forum's publications include Education Reporter, bringing you important news about parents' rights and public school curriculum.

692
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Eagle Forum sponsors activities especially for college students and for Teen Eagles, including an annual Collegians Leadership Summit held each summer in Washington, D.C.

693
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:15,000

I want to thank Dr. Thomas Sowell for joining us today on Eagle Forum Live.

697
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He is one of the country's great scholars, a national treasure, and a reliable guide to help us separate rhetoric from reality.

698
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
His ability is absolutely critical at this juncture in our national history.

699
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I highly recommend all of his books, as well as his syndicated column.

700
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If everyone would read a couple of his books, a lot fewer people would be misled by smooth-talking politicians.

701
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You can find a link to his latest book, Dismantling America, at the Eagle Forum website.

702
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's EagleForum.org. Be sure to join Phyllis next week.

703
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And Phyllis, next week, did you know that one of the Pilgrim ships that was captured by Muslim pirates was sold into slavery in Morocco?

704
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A historian will share some stories of the past that still affect us today, right here on Eagle Forum Live.
