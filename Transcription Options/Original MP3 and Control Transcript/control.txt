Welcome to Eagle Forum Live, and here's your host, Phyllis Schlafly.
Phyllis Schlafly
We are very excited to have with us today Doctor Thomas Sowell, Distinguished economist, social critic and political commentator. Dr. Sol is a senior fellow on public. Policy at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.
Bill Hayes
This is a Special Eagle Forum live with Phyllis Schlafly and of course, her special guest today, Thomas Sowelll. They have the whole hour, so please, we're not taking questions and comments from listeners today. Our regular format continues next week right here on Eagle Forum Live.
Phyllis Schlafly
Even informed citizens sometimes have a hard time getting through the fog of political rhetoric to decide if government policies are good or bad. They can get a lot of help from the writing of today's guests. He investigates the facts and examines similar policies. And then he applies common sense and logic. Doctor Thomas Sowell is the author of more than 30 books, and we're going to talk today about his most recent book called Dismantling America, which is a collection of columns that showcase his views on political, cultural, economic. And legal issues. Welcome, Doctor soul. And tell us what is the meaning of the title of your newest book?
Thomas Sowell
I think that the current administration is doing more than simply passing policies that are very questionable in themselves. What they're doing is changing the whole procedure by which the American Government operates, and I think that's going to do long run damage, even if the policies themselves get repealed. For example, this practice of passing enormously large and far reaching bills without any opportunity for the public to know what's in them or and and in some cases for even most members of Congress to know what's in them. Things like: The waivers, for example, they can give to certain companies from the provisions of the new health care law, well the ability to give way was is the ability to withhold waivers and therefore to punish people who dare to speak out. One of the insurance companies recently said that they were going to have to raise premiums because of the Obamacare legislation. Well, they were immediately told by one of the cabinet members that there will be zero tolerance For what they what the administration calls misinformation, which is to say that the the this insurance company can look for federal or retaliation for having spoken the truth.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, isn't socialism not just spreading the wealth around, it's being able to spread the wealth to your pals and make sure your friends get the goodies.
Thomas Sowell
Oh, absolutely. I mean the the the administration is they're they're great at rhetoric, that's their strong suit. And so they say they're against special interests. But that just means that the, their special interests aren't called special interest.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, what do you think about Obama appointing all these czars who never had Senate confirmation?
Thomas Sowell
That, again, it's circumventing the Constitution and it's circumventing the public because the constitution is the vehicle that allows the public to determine what kind of laws they want to live under. And so if, if you can appoint people and call them saws instead of cabinet members, even though they may wield powers greater than the cabinet members. If you can do that, you've circumvented the Constitution. And the Constitution can't protect us unless we first protect the Constitution. That is, unless we vote against people who circumvent the Constitution, even if the particular policy that they vote for may not be particularly objectionable in themselves.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, why is anybody surprised? Obama said that he wanted to fundamentally transform the United States of America.
Thomas Sowell
Well, I think no one believed that he meant what he was actually going to do. They  may have thought this was just some political rhetoric, but everything in the man's past suggests that he is fundamentally opposed to the values and the procedures and the governing principles of this country and so Now they're shocked to discover that He is what he's always been, but which they didn't bother to find out before voting.
Phyllis Schlafly
We're talking today with Doctor Thomas Sowell about his new book, Dismantling America, and he has, Obama has given us so many bad decisions. What's your comment about about the bailing out the people who bought houses that they couldn't afford?
Thomas Sowell
It's it's unbelievable. What is unbelievable, if not that the government would do that. Because the government do so many questionable things just for short run political advantage, what is incredible is there's so little criticism of it. When, when the obvious objection is that, why should I, who never owned the House until I was 50 years old and have never. Owned a house that is as costly as some of these that we're bailing out. Why should I have to pay for these people who went ahead and bought a house that they couldn't afford?
Phyllis Schlafly
That's right, that really annoys me as much as anything. My mother and father never owned a house, and the idea that you'd be a better citizen if somebody induced you to buy a house that you really couldn't afford it is just an offensive idea.
Thomas Sowell
Well, that notion that housing determines behavior goes back well over 100 years and it is defied over 100 years of evidence to the conttrary. T. It's certainly true that if you find a neighborhood with nice houses, chances are it will have a nice and they'll have a lower crime rates. It'll have better schools and so forth. But these this is this is the post hoc fallacy. I mean, people of a certain kind go to have certain kinds of houses, and they have Certain kinds of educational values.
Phyllis Schlafly
We're talking today with Doctor Thomas Sowell and you mentioned the book that when you were in your 20s, you were a little bit fascinated by the Marxist philosophy. What persuaded you that private enterprise was better than the government running the economy.
Thomas Sowell
Working for the government. You know, I was. I was still a Marxist after I had taken a course from Milton Friedman, but within three months of going to work for the government, I began to change because I realized that I was in the Labor Department, that government agencies have their own priorities. And to expect them to carry out policies that benefit others when in fact their main purpose is to benefit themselves is just a very unrealistic.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, what about the whole idea that if government runs it such as healthcare, it's gonna cost less?
Thomas Sowell
I don't know what, what what The government runs that has ever cost less.
Phyllis Schlafly
You think government coming into it is a major reason for the extraordinary rise in tuition? You're on a college campus.
Thomas Sowell
Ohh yes, my goodness there been studies that show for every dollar of government aid to education, tuition rises by $0.50. So you when you start increasing government aid, it's like a dog chasing his tail. I mean he he doesn't get any close from him about how fast he runs.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, they've unfortunately have sold a lot of people on this idea that the government running Healthcare is going to save us all money as well as give us better health. And now Obama has put  a Czar in front who's thinks the the British system is really great.
Thomas Sowell
Oh my goodness. I'm staggered and I'm very disappointed in American media because there's so much in the British media about what is wrong with their medical system. I mean the women who, for example, who have had, who've had their babies in British hospitals, not in the operating room, but in elevators and in the hallways and so forth because they get neglected to the point where the baby is coming and there's nobody there to take care of them.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, the I think the American people have caught on to what's wrong with Obamacare. Because I think Obama thought we were all going to like it after the law was passed. But it now appears that the majority of the American people really do want to repeal it.
Thomas Sowell
Well, I'm. I would even question whether he believed that or whether he simply said that because if you really believe the people are going to like this after the law was passed, you would have it go into effect certainly before the 2012 presidential election and perhaps before the 2010 congressional elections. But in fact, the law. Was written to go into effect after the 2012 election, so it's clearly he felt that this was something that he wanted to put in there. And whether the people like it or not, there won't be much they can do about it. If they'd only learn about it After he's been reelected.

You've probably heard that all public schools are mandated to give reading tests, and many parents are worrying whether their children will pass. If you want to find out if your child's reading skills are all they should be, we invite you to give Eagle Forum’s first reading test in the privacy of your own home. Any child who has finished first grade should be able to pass this test. It will enable you to find out if your child can really read, or if he has been taught to memorize a few dozen frequently used words and then just guess at other words from the pictures on the page. Eagle forums' simple test will tell you whether your child is really reading. Don't let your child fall behind in school because he is a poor reader. Call 1-800-700-5228 and ask for our free reading test. That's 1-800-700-5228, and you can see Eagle forums, First reading test on the website turboreader.com. Look up the website www.turboreader.com.

Just about every week, Phyllis Schlafly takes questions and comments. But this week, Phyllis is going the full hour with her special guest, Thomas Sowell, Eagle Forum Live continues here. Again, Phyllis Schlafly.
Phyllis Schlafly
We're talking today with Doctor Thomas Sowell, of the Hoover Institution in California. Here and I want to switch the subject a little bit to education. I know you write on that and in many of your books and the the misuse of words for example, now they're trying to tell us that national standards are the way to go. And of course the word social justice Has become very trendy In the schools and tell us what that really means.
Thomas Sowell
Oh my, I must confess at the outset that I am totally. It's totally beyond my ability to tell you what that phrase means because I have read books going back 100 years and nobody has ever defined it. I guess what t they have in mind is that. All sorts of groups ought to be equally represented in all sorts of places. Which is particularly amazing to me after having spent decades studying ethnic and other groups around the world, nowhere on this planet do I find groups that are the same. I mean, if black and white Americans, for example, were the same, they would be the only two groups on this planet that are the same, I mean. The northern Italians and southern Italians aren't the same. The Scottish Lowlands-lowlanders and Scottish Highlanders are the same people in North Korea are not the same as people in South Korea. I mean, you can go through everywhere you go that there are Different groups you find incredible differences. You find differences in alcoholism rates, infant mortality rates, you name it. There are differences. And yet so many of our policies and even our court decisions are based on the notion that if all the groups aren't the same in some respect, somebody else must be to blame.
Phyllis Schlafly
And well, I think social justice in many cases has come to mean teaching the kids that they live in an unjust, oppressive, racist society.
Thomas Sowell
Yes, yes.
Phyllis Schlafly
And therefore they must organize under some community organizer and take power and wealth away from people who have it.
Thomas Sowell
Oh, absolutely, absolutely. And
Phyllis Schlafly
You know, it's funny, Doctor S,owell not only have some of these words become bad, but it's funny the way the White House recognizes that the word stimulus has become a negative word because people don't believe the stimulus spending did stimulate any jobs, at least in private. Industry.
Thomas Sowell
Well, I think that most of the evidence would justify substituting the word sedative for stimulus that I've  done some research on this and you can trace the banks to which which the in which the government dumped great sums of money and discovered that the following year they made substantially fewer loans. Than they made the previous year and similarly in other areas where they've dumped all this money and the money just sits there. I mean, right now both the banks and private industry as well as individuals have more money sitting idle than they have had in decades.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, I think the money that did get spent got spent to create more government jobs.
Thomas Sowell
Oh, absolutely.
Phyllis Schlafly
Not private enterprise jobs.
Thomas Sowell
No. And what the great problem is that the various policies of the administration. Are making it more difficult to create private industry jobs and the government jobs that they create. Obviously the government doesn't create any wealth, so they take the wealth out of the private economy, use it to create the government jobs. But of course that means the private economy has less money to create jobs than they had before. And so there's no net increase in jobs. 
Phyllis Schlafly
I wish, Doctor Sowell you talk a little bit about your views about immigration and how we used to assimilate the immigrants into our society, but they're not doing that now and we we hope that we would be a great country. I saw Marco Rubio saying, On television that his father was a bartender and his wife was a waitress, his mother was a waitress. And it was such a great country. Now he's running for the senate. And America, America is such a great country where this can happen, he pointed out How that absolutely could not happen in the Cuba that he came from.
Thomas Sowell
Ohh absolutely.
Phyllis Schlafly
And and Obama doesn't believe we're at exceptional, unique country.
Thomas Sowell
Not at all. And Heaven knows he should have more reason than most people to be glad he was born here. The whole, the whole you're right about the immigrants. I mean, people point out how all these millions of European immigrants were integrated into the society and so on. It's true, but it's also true that most of these groups did so by making great efforts, sometimes individual, and sometimes organized efforts to assimilate to the American Society today. Not only is that not happening in the organizational sense, the organizations that exist to represent different groups. Such as La Raza, for example, are doing their best to keep the foreigners foreign. And and These activists have such gall that they, they, they have even opposed letting the parents of children. That is the Hispanic parents of Hispanic children, decide whether they want the kids to be taught in English or Spanish because they know the parents want their children taught in English. Because that's where how, how they'll get ahead.
Phyllis Schlafly
I remember actually it was during the Bush administration I tried to get Congress to say that the use of the bilingual education money coming from the federal government would be parents option. And well, everybody was against that. They didn't want parents to have the option.
Thomas Sowell
Yeah. That's right. Well, you know, this is part of the general arrogance that extends far beyond this issue. They want to be able to decide what is right and to the extent possible, cut the ordinary people out of out of  the loop. I mean that. That's why these bills were passed with. So in such a hurry, even when their bills, they won't take place. Until years later. So it's not like they're hurrying to get the thing in operation. They're hurrying to get it passed before the rest of us can find out. And that really permeates everything that they say and do.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, Nancy Pelosi was even pretty frank about that said we have to pass the bill and then you'll find out what's in it.
Thomas Sowell
That's right. And that that is the attitude so many people think of the left as being for the common man. I've been on the left, I've studied the left. The left is for the left making the decisions and being and having those decisions handed down to the rest of us where we can like it or lump it.
Phyllis Schlafly
One of the things that I find really disturbing about President Obama is the way he wants to bow to world opinion and apologize for us around the world. Would you? I know you've had a number of columns on that covered in your book dismantling America, which is a wonderful new book. Comment on that,we want to maintain our individual identity as the land of freedom and prosperity.
Thomas Sowell
Well, absolutely. But again, this is a man who I don't believe Has any faith in America as it is, and who thinks our only redeeming feature is that can elect people like him to change us to what he thinks we Ought to be. And I think this is part of that the next to Susan has has argued that he really has the sort of third world Mentality of envy and resentment of the United States and my feeling isvery much the same. That this is not a man who loves this country. This is not a man who is dedicated to his values, and it's incredible to me that the American people could have elected such a man. And. To this to the High Office he has which which means he holds really our lives in his hands. Without knowing what, he not only not without knowing what he was like from his track record, but disregarding what they do know about his past in order to invest him with their what they imagined to be his good qualities.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, he led a privileged life in our country. He never had a real job. He he talked about all these shovel ready jobs, he never handled any shovels.
Thomas Sowell
You know, one of the one of the this is this goes beyond Obama. But one of the things that is amazed to me is that people who were born in very humble circumstances. I have so, so often been so dedicated to this country and people who have given all sorts of privileges, including in millionaires. Have turned against us, you know, right after 911, when there were all these, all these American flags were flying in various neighborhoods and homes and other places. I went out to the University of California at Berkeley. And on that entire campus, I did not see one American flag flying. The first American flag that I saw was on my way back from Berkeley when I was passing through a low income black neighborhood in Oakland. That's where I first saw an American flag flying.
Phyllis Schlafly
What? What do you think would happen if we actually enforced our laws against illegal immigration? Would our crops rot in the field? We won't be able to eat strawberries anymore, and the chicken plants will go out of business.
Thomas Sowell
Do you know what? what gets me is that we have had chronic agricultural surpluses that cost the taxpayers billions of dollars every year. And so even if the agricultural output went down, there isn't the slightest danger that we'd be without strawberries or anything else.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, the, I think the the two political parties do cooperate in winking their eyes at this illegal immigration you, you know, they've now admitted that the fence the the virtual fence was a billion dollar mistake  it won't work at all.
Thomas Sowell
Well, I don't think was a mistake from this standpoint It it got the political pressure off them and it was worth the sports to spend the billion dollars worth of the taxpayers money for that. Whether I don't, I'm not at all convinced that they ever thought and the at the outset of this thing was going to work.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, one of our congressmen, the 1 from Iowa, Steve King, who was in the construction business before he had a real job before he went to Congress. I show, I saw him on C-SPAN showing how he would build a fence and how he would pour the concrete and had put the blocks in. And he had a model and it looked pretty simple. We could hire some of those people to build the fence.
Thomas Sowell
You, you know, it's not like building a fence is not not not some unprecedented problem.
Phyllis Schlafly
It's not rocket science.
Thomas Sowell
No, I mean, you know, I've seen the Berlin Wall, I saw the fence between China and Hong Kong before Hong Kong became part of China. And you just don't get over those kinds of fences because you're, they're they're serious about stopping you now. If you're going to have a fence where you can easily. Run it, run up the side of the fence and bolt right on over. Well, of course it's not going to be very effective, but that doesn't mean there are no effective fences. If there, if there were no effective fences, the entire population of Eastern Europe would probably have moved to Western Europe during the year of the Soviet Union.
Phyllis Schlafly
Good point.

Phyllis Schlafly
We're talking today with Doctor Thomas Sowell, and I know that you've, you know, what's going on with the universities. Do you see a change in the students, the student body now, from what it was when you started out teaching in colleges.
Thomas Sowell
Well, I haven't actually taught in about the last 30 years, but I think that's not. But I obviously did see some changes because I really. I started my academic career with to be a teacher, not  to be a writer and researcher, but I saw enough changes between the time I first started in 1962 and in 1980 when I taught my last class that I realized that this was just no longer where I wanted to be.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, they haven't read much of anything. They don't know much history.
Thomas Sowell
Oh my gosh, no, you can't. You can't presuppose anything in teaching because, well, and least of all history, there are all sorts of places that, I mean, we're talking prestigious places where you can graduate without a clue about the history of this country.
Phyllis Schlafly
Yes, I understand there's one California University where you can fulfill the history requirement by taking a course in the history of rock'n'roll.
Thomas Sowell
Yes. Well, there are all kinds of these sort of boutique courses and highly specialized things and they're very easy for the professors to teach because the professor, you know, does a doctoral dissertation on the on the history of wine making in France. Well, he has a ton of material. It's far easier for him to teach a course on the history of wine making in France. Than the teacher course you know on the history of Europe or in the history of the United States.
Phyllis Schlafly
Doctor Sowell,  we've been talking about the great variety of subjects you deal with in your latest book, Dismantling America. But I have to tell you my favorite one of your books is you're one about intellectuals. And I have to ask you to give some of your choice Remarks of what you think about intellectuals and their influence on our society.
Thomas Sowell
Well, at all, the influence is the easiest to summarize, I think it has been largely negative. They have been part of this process which really set the stage for the dismantling of America. They've been, Enormously critical of everything that has happened in this country, they've taken the sins of the human race, which are common around the world, and they've talked about them as if as if they are the peculiarities of our society, of virtually everything bad that is going on in the history of this country has gone on to a worse extent, and most other countries around the world. And yet you never learn. You never learn any of that. My gosh, one of the things they love to talk about is slavery in the United States and in.
Phyllis Schlafly
Oh, it's endless. They talk about it all the time.
Thomas Sowell
You would think that the only people who were ever enslaved were blacks who were enslaved by whites in the United States. What most in European Society? Neither. I think most of the slaves in the history of the world would neither black nor white
Phyllis Schlafly
 They were the people who were conquered in war, weren't they?
Thomas Sowell
They were. They were people who were, who were abducted by pirates. There was slavery every everywhere you found human beings, you found Slavery. I mean, there was a time and not that many centuries ago when people could not conceive of a world without slavery. I mean the the, the Christian monasteries in Europe, the Buddhist monasteries in Asia had slaves, even in the ideal society. In the novel of Utopia, utopia had slaves. They couldn't even concieve an ideal society without slaves, what was peculiar about the United States and about Western civilization was that this was the first, and for a long time, the only civilization that turned against it and destroyed it. But that we never hear.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, this thing about crying about past sins, you know, I spent 10 years of my life fighting the equal Rights Amendment, and I can't tell you how many times I was in a debate before a legislative hearing or elsewhere. And my opponent is still crying about the time when women didn't have the right to vote In this country now at my advanced stage, I don't even know anybody who can remember that time, but there's still whining about it.
Thomas Sowell
Oh yeah, and the other thing too, is that a great injustice to your ancestors is not necessarily a great injustice to you. If you look at the history of Western Europe and Western Europe became illiterate because the Romans conquered it. Now nobody considers the Romans sweethearts. I mean, they slaughtered people by the thousands. They oppressed the people they conquered. And so forth. But the net result. Well, for for today's Western Europeans, is that their society has got a huge advantage over Eastern Europe because their languages, for example, had Roman letters centuries before the languages of Eastern Europe had letters and and and. And you see that reflected to this day. And I think quite similarly here in the United States. There's no question that people who were brought in bondage to Africa from Africa are here to be mistreated and so forth. They suffered a lot. But of course, the reason the black population in the United States is the most prosperous black population in the world was because of the injustices done to our ancestors.
Phyllis Schlafly
We're talking today with Doctor Thomas Sowell. Let me ask you this question the, the all the polls show that self identified conservatives outnumber liberals, self identified liberals about 2:00 to 1:00. But yet we've elected the most left wing president in history. That doesn't make sense. How did that happen?
Thomas Sowell
I think and in a few words, the ineptness of the Republican Party, I mean, it's like when you have dealt the high cards in the game and your opponent wins it.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, that's that's that's the way it is. Well, we hope that the elections are going to change that because the remedies I think the remedies for our problems are there in the Constitution.
Thomas Sowell
Absolutely.
Phyllis Schlafly
And that's apparently the Liberals are very much annoyed when Tea Partiers hold up copies of the Constitution and say we have to get back to the Constitution. But that's really what we do need to do.
Thomas Sowell
Absolutely. Because that's really what enables us To be a self governing Country. And have freedom.
Phyllis Schlafly
Now, now getting back to foreign policy, you seem very concerned about Iran getting nuclear bombs. What about that?
Thomas Sowell
I can't. I can't understand why other people aren't concerned. I mean, after 911, what we understand what the terrorists are like, and to think of those same people who did 9/11 as having nuclear weapons ought to send a chill through through, through every American. And the other thing is we it's not like the Soviets having nuclear weapons because the Soviets, whatever their faults, were not suicidal and they knew that if they bombed New York, we would wipe Moscow off the face of the earth. The people in Iran don't care about the people who run Iran, the people who live there care, the people who have dictatorial power and. Iran off fanatics and if if they if they can wipe out the New York and Chicago and Los Angeles and we we wipe out Tehran they've come out ahead ahead of the game as far as they're concerned.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, they teach that suicide is great. That's your key to heaven.
Thomas Sowell
That's right. So I mean, you can't, you cannot deter suicide bombers. And so suicide bombers with nuclear weapons are just the most frightening thing in the world.
Phyllis Schlafly
Do you think that what Obama is doing is taking us into European-style socialism?
Thomas Sowell
Yes.
Phyllis Schlafly
And why is that so awful?
Thomas Sowell
Among men? Well, first of all, you have to go through all the things that are wrong with European style socialists. They they don't have, they typically have higher unemployment rates than we do unemployment at the last longer than we do their medical systems run by government are far, far inferior to ours and so on. But I think the thing that really is the point of no return is a nuclear Iran. Because, you know, it took only two bombs for Japan to surrender after at the end of World War 2. I think the Japanese were a lot tougher then, than we are now. I do not see this country doing anything other than surrendering. I mean, it may be inconceivable to most people that the United States would ever surrender, but it was inconceivable that Japan would surrender. It had never surrendered in its whole history. And yet, just those two bombs did it. Iran. The fact that we may have, you know, 100 bombs or 100 times as many bombs as Iran means absolutely nothing if they're willing to die. And we're not.
Phyllis Schlafly
You do make an interesting note that liberals are generally more articulate in putting forth their policies than conservatives, so they come up with all these smart phrases that sound good and do you have any advice for conservatives who want to do a better job of communicating other than passing around your books, of course.
Thomas Sowell
I think one of the things you first have to  Know that being articulate is important in politics. I'm appalled at how little effort and thought Republicans seem to put into what they say during election campaigns. I mean, I was was appalled. You know, I think of Bob Dole having 45 minutes on the air and just frittering it away. Not addressing any of the problems you know you can't do something unless you know what it is you want to do. And I think that's one of the things that ought to be at the top of their list. But I see no sign that they're improving.

The biggest scandal in education today is allowing children to be promoted from grade to grade and even graduate from high school without ever learning how to read. Schools should teach kids how to read in the 1st grade by a real phonics method. Parents can be easily fooled because first graders are able to memorize a few dozen one syllable words. And then the books use those same words over and over again. How can you tell if your child is really reading, or if he's just reciting a few words he's memorized and guessing at Others? Phyllis Schlafly has developed a simple reading test you can use at home to find out whether your child can actually read or is just guessing at the words. Make sure your son or daughter has every chance to succeed. Don't leave it up to the schools to teach your child this vital skill. Order your free reading test by calling 1-800-700-5228.

Phyllis Schlafly
Welcome back to Eagle Forum live. This is Phyllis Schlafly, and we're continuing with the great economist Thomas Sowell, explaining why Republicans are often very inarticulate in explaining what they want to do.
Thomas Sowell
I remember back during the 1994 government shutdown when the plain fact was that the Republican Congress had voted more money than the government had,had before. And so there was no shortage of money to run the government. And yet when, when Clinton began pushing the idea that Republicans have caused the government to shut down by  Not giving them enough money. The Republicans came on the air, and they started talking about OMB statistics versus CBO statistics. Well, good heavens, man, you need to come on the air and say no. No, we gave him the money, He chose not to do it and he's lying. I mean, that people can understand that. But if you want to go all around, talk, talk, Washington speak, you can't expect the public to understand what you're talking about.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, I remember meeting with the Republican leadership at that time. And I said, well, what is your Plan B if Clinton doesn't do what you expect, and they didn't have any Plan B. I want to ask you another question. We want more transparency. As Obama said. But we some people have urges that all congressional hearings and court proceedings and arguments be televised, but you don't think that's a helpful idea, right?
Thomas Sowell
Not at all. If I had my way, I would cut out the C-SPAN coverage of of Congress. These these are these are staged events. These are not Sort of candid camera kinds of looks at how Congress is working the Congress, the people in Congress know that the camera is on and they behave and say things in front of the camera that have nothing to do with what they're going to do when they make their backroom deals. And so this is a charade for the sake of the public.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, and I don't think people would get much out of the arguments before the courts either. I kind of agree with you on that.
Thomas Sowell
Especially there because unless you know the legal framework, you have no idea. I mean, especially an appellate court. I mean maybe, maybe a trial court you you could figure out who's guilty and who's innocent. But an appellate court is not not not taking that, not making that decision. They're deciding whether the rules of the game were played when this trial was held, and unless you happen to know what what the procedure should have been, you have no way of knowing whether what was done was good, bad or indifferent.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, you talk about need some clever words to describe some of these people who are destroying our heritage. My word for the judges is supremacists, because they really think they really do think they're supreme over the other branches of government and and the people. What about That?
Thomas Sowell
They tragically, they are so long as nobody objects. I mean, you know, I was going to.
Phyllis Schlafly
Would you, would you agree with me that that the, the, the founding fathers plan for the judiciary to be the least powerful branch of government, but the judges have made it the most powerful because they're deciding all these major issues?
Thomas Sowell
Oh, absolutely. And then there's another judge who's decided, That firefighters can't be promoted in new in New York because they they don't have the right demographic makes the people who pass the test. Now no one gave them that power. But unless someone challenges it, you know, people like that are not going to stop unless they get stopped. And yet the idea has gotten out there. And to be against judges is to be against the rule of law. Well, the rule of law was never meant to be simply the rule of judges.
Phyllis Schlafly
You have another interesting book called Economic Facts and Fallacies. What are these? What are a Couple of these fallacies that people have fallen for?
Thomas Sowell
Ohh my heavens, there, there there is a notion that. Oh, I guess tax cuts for the rich are one of those that. When the taxes are cut, there are the benefits. Benefits go simply to the rich. And of course the the there's, there's a lot of confusion between tax rates and tax revenue. Tax rates can go down and tax Rep while tax revenues go up. And in fact, many of the tax rate cuts beginning in the 1920s and then during the Kennedy administration and the Reagan and Bush administrations have in fact brought in more revenue to the federal government because people no longer keep their money in tax shelters, they invested in the economy. And that then causes the economy to grow and the government to make more taxes, to collect more tax revenues, even though the rate of taxation has been lowered . But you never hear that. You hear that it's tax cuts for the rich.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, back to your one of your favorite subjects. The what's the matter with the intellectuals? Isn't 1 of the additional things that matter with them? Is that there, There's no, there's no punishment in the in the whole system when they make wrong decisions and encourage bad policies.
Thomas Sowell
Ohh absolutely you you can advocatepolicies as was done in France in the 30s, that end up undermining the nation's National Defense so that France, which had fought for four long years against the German invaders during the First World War, collapsed after six weeks of fighting in the Second World War. But there's no intellectual who could be punished for that. That was just one of the things that happened. And certainly academics can't be punished if they turn out people from the universities who graduate not understanding of the history of the country, the nature of constitutional government, or any of the other things that they need in order to be decent citizens.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, if you build a fence and it falls down, I guess you could be sued for faulty work.
Thomas Sowell
Yeah, but it's virtually impossible to sue an intellectual for faulty work. You can't even fire a faculty member who advocates policies that produce financial ruin for the college.
Phyllis Schlafly
You, of course, are an economist. What do you think about, Nixon saying we're all Keynesians now, and I understand that the British and now have specifically rejected Keynesianism.
Thomas Sowell
Oh heavens, I think a lot of people have rejected it. When Obama, what was president-elect, He was saying that we all know that we have to spend more and concordance with the Keynesian theory. A group of large number of economists in fact, took out full page ads, many of them by economists with Nobel Prizes in economics, saying no, we don't have to do that. But no, and unfortunately, Richard Nixon would say almost anything if it was politically expedient.
Phyllis Schlafly
One question we hadn't gotten around to is what do you think about the danger of the Muslims today?
Thomas Sowell
Very great danger. And what is more dangerous? Is that we dare not speak it as, as Juan Williams discovered recently on NPR. But in many of the countries of Europe, merely to warn about the dangers from the extremists among the Muslims is the court being prosecuted under hate speech. I mean I think that that sort of thing will undoubtedly come to this country if Obama gets a second term.
Phyllis Schlafly
Well, whatever happened to all this diversity? People were preaching.
Thomas Sowell
Well, the rest. Is one of those other fraudulent words? I mean, the diversity on a college campus means black, leftist, white, leftist, female, leftist, and Hispanic leftist. I mean, that's diversity. But diversity of ideas, and after all, the university exists for ideas, not for demographic representation  but diversity of ideas is virtually unknown at most of the college and university campuses in the country.
Phyllis Schlafly
You have so many important books, which one would you recommend for the general public? You do have a very you have a book that has basic in the title. It's basic economics.
Thomas Sowell
It's economics. Yes, it's the one that is. Sold the most copies here and has been translated into the most languages overseas.
Phyllis Schlafly
And it's it gives people a basic understanding of what economics are all about.
Thomas Sowell
Yeah. Without yes, without graphs, without equations and without jargon.
Phyllis Schlafly
How about without math?
Thomas Sowell
No math. Well, there's one. There's one arithmetic example, but if you if you can master addition and subtraction in your home free. 
Phyllis Schlafly
We've certainly had an interesting conversation with Doctor Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institution. He's written many books. I recommend them all. His latest book is called Dismantling America. It's a lot of his common sense logic to Explain what's going on in language that the average voter can understand. I recommend it highly. Also, his other books, the one on intellectuals and society. And the one on basic economics. Thank you so much, Doctor Sowell, for being with us today. We appreciate your time. Keep up the good work. Keep writing.
Thomas Sowell
Thank you very much for having me.

I want to thank Doctor Thomas Sowell for joining us today on Eagle Forum Live. He is one of the country's great scholars, a national treasure and a reliable guide to help us separate rhetoric from reality. His ability is absolutely critical at this juncture in our national History. I highly recommend all of his books as well as his syndicated column. If everyone would read a couple of his books, a lot fewer people would be misled by smooth talking politicians. You can find a link to his latest book, Dismantling America, at the Eagle Forum website.
